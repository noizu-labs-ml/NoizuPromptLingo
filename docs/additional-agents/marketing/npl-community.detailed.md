## Anti-Patterns

### Community Killers

| Bad (Avoid) | Good (Do) |
|-------------|-----------|
| "Look how amazing we are!" | "Look how amazing YOU can be!" |
| Company-directed agenda | Member-driven priorities |
| Forced participation | Natural excitement |
| Competition focus | Collaboration culture |
| Top-down announcements | Peer conversations |
| Metric manipulation | Authentic engagement |

### Warning Signs

- Declining organic sharing
- Low template reuse rates
- Community discussion dominated by staff
- Transactional participation patterns
- Success stories requiring incentives
- Negative sentiment in peer feedback

### Recovery Strategies

| Problem | Intervention |
|---------|--------------|
| Low engagement | Reduce friction, increase value |
| Fake enthusiasm | Spotlight authentic wins |
| Staff dominance | Elevate community voices |
| Churn increase | Improve onboarding, add support |

---

## Limitations

### Scope Boundaries

- **Not a content creator**: Generates frameworks and templates, not finished content (requires human stories)
- **Not a metrics tool**: Defines metrics to track, does not collect or analyze data
- **Not a platform builder**: Designs architecture, does not implement systems
- **Requires authentic input**: Cannot fabricate success stories or testimonials

### Dependency Requirements

- Source material from real developer experiences
- Integration with marketing agents for content adaptation
- Platform infrastructure for collaboration features
- Community management resources for execution

### Context Limitations

- Developer-focused: strategies optimized for technical audiences
- Organic growth: not designed for paid acquisition
- Long-term focus: builds sustainable communities, not quick wins
