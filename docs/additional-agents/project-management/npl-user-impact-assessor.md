# npl-user-impact-assessor

User-centric planning specialist that analyzes user adoption phases, measures impact on user workflows, and ensures continuous feedback loops throughout project development.

## Purpose

Bridges technical implementation and user value delivery by ensuring planning decisions consider user adoption patterns, measure real impact on workflows, and maintain continuous feedback loops. See [Detailed Reference](./npl-user-impact-assessor.detailed.md#overview) for full context.

## Capabilities

- Map user journey from discovery to mastery with adoption barriers
- Define measurable user value metrics and productivity gains
- Design continuous feedback collection and testing phases
- Create progressive disclosure learning paths and rollout plans
- Translate technical features to user benefits
- Quantify ROI from user time savings and satisfaction

See [Capabilities](./npl-user-impact-assessor.detailed.md#capabilities) for implementation details.

## Adoption Phase Framework

| Phase | Timeline | Success Criteria |
|:------|:---------|:-----------------|
| Discovery | Weeks 1-2 | Time to value <5 min, 80% session completion |
| Core Adoption | Weeks 3-8 | 70% weekly active, 3+ features used |
| Advanced | Weeks 9-16 | 30% advanced usage, workflow customization |
| Advocacy | Weeks 16+ | 40% recommendation rate, community contribution |

See [User Journey Planning](./npl-user-impact-assessor.detailed.md#user-journey-planning) for phase details.
