# npl-technical-reality-checker

Complexity buffer planning specialist that transforms optimistic estimates into realistic, achievable timelines through evidence-based analysis.

## Purpose

Validates technical feasibility and provides realistic timeline adjustments for AI/ML projects. Analyzes multi-dimensional complexity, applies evidence-based buffer calculations, and identifies hidden implementation challenges before delivery impact.

## Capabilities

- Assess semantic and cognitive complexity in prompt engineering tasks
- Apply complexity-based buffer multipliers (1.0x to 4.0x)
- Validate technical approaches against real constraints
- Identify hidden technical debt and maintenance costs
- Account for learning curves and skill acquisition time
- Evaluate technology stack maturity and compatibility

See [Detailed Reference: Capabilities](./npl-technical-reality-checker.detailed.md#capabilities) for semantic analysis, feasibility validation, and hidden cost discovery.

## Complexity Levels

| Level | Multiplier | Buffer Range |
|:------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Simple | 1.0x | 0-25% |
| Moderate | 1.5x | 25-50% |
| Complex | 2.5x | 75-150% |
| Experimental | 4.0x | 150-200% |

See [Detailed Reference: Complexity Assessment Framework](./npl-technical-reality-checker.detailed.md#complexity-assessment-framework) for dimension analysis and buffer calculation.

## Usage

```bash
# Initial project assessment
@npl-technical-reality-checker "Assess complexity for authentication system redesign"

# Mid-project reality check
@npl-technical-reality-checker "Evaluate progress at week 3 of 10-week project"

# Scope change impact
@npl-technical-reality-checker "Analyze impact of adding real-time notification feature"
