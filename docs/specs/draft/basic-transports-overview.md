# Transports Overview

This page defines what a transport must provide to carry MCP messages, the
standard transport bindings, and the requirements for defining new ones.

Protocol semantics are identical on every transport. A transport is a
**binding**: it defines how messages are framed and delivered, how request
metadata is carried, and how cancellation and termination are signaled. It
does not define what the messages mean: the
[message patterns](/specification/draft/basic/patterns) are part of the core
protocol and are the same on every binding. The binding pages specify the
standard transports:

1. [stdio](/specification/draft/basic/transports/stdio): newline-delimited
   messages over the standard streams of a client-launched subprocess.
2. [Streamable HTTP](/specification/draft/basic/transports/streamable-http):
   each message is an HTTP POST to a single MCP endpoint; replies arrive as
   a JSON object or a request-scoped SSE stream.

It is also possible for clients and servers to implement
[custom transports](#custom-transports).

## Messages

MCP uses JSON-RPC to encode messages. JSON-RPC messages **MUST** be UTF-8
encoded.

A binding **MUST** deliver client-sent *requests* and *notifications* to the
server, and server-sent *responses* and *notifications* to the client. No
other message direction exists: per the
[message patterns](/specification/draft/basic/patterns), servers do not
initiate JSON-RPC requests and clients do not send JSON-RPC responses.

## Request Metadata

All protocol metadata travels in the message body: every request carries its
protocol version, client identity, and client capabilities in
[`_meta.io.modelcontextprotocol/*`](/specification/draft/basic/index#meta)
fields.

A binding **MAY** additionally mirror selected body fields into envelope
metadata. The Streamable HTTP transport mirrors them into
[HTTP headers](/specification/draft/basic/transports/streamable-http#request-metadata)
so that intermediaries can route and inspect requests without parsing the
body. The body remains the source of truth; bindings that mirror metadata
define how mismatches are rejected.

## Cancellation

Each binding defines how a client abandons an in-flight request: on stdio
the client sends a `notifications/cancelled` notification; on Streamable
HTTP it closes the request's response stream. The protocol-level rules are
the same everywhere; see
[Cancellation](/specification/draft/basic/patterns/cancellation).

## Custom Transports

Clients and servers **MAY** implement additional custom transport mechanisms
to suit their specific needs. The protocol is transport-agnostic and can be
implemented over any communication channel that supports bidirectional
message exchange.

Implementers who choose to support custom transports **MUST** preserve the
JSON-RPC message format, the
[message patterns](/specification/draft/basic/patterns), and the per-request
metadata model. Custom transports **SHOULD** document their connection
establishment, message framing, and cancellation patterns to aid
interoperability.

Custom transports that run over a reliable bidirectional byte stream (e.g.,
Unix domain sockets or TCP) **SHOULD** reuse the
[stdio framing](/specification/draft/basic/transports/stdio) rather than
defining a new one: the stdio binding is just newline-delimited JSON-RPC
over a byte stream, and only its process-lifecycle rules are specific to
standard streams.

## Backward Compatibility

Earlier protocol revisions established a connection-scoped session with an
`initialize` handshake and allowed servers to initiate JSON-RPC requests.
Clients and servers that interoperate with those revisions detect the
counterpart's era and fall back as described in
[Versioning: Backward Compatibility](/specification/draft/basic/versioning#backward-compatibility-with-initialization-based-versions),
which includes a compatibility matrix for implementors. Each binding page
describes its transport-specific detection mechanics.
