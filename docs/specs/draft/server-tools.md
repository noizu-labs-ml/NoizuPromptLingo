# Tools

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows servers to expose tools that can be invoked by
language models. Tools enable models to interact with external systems, such as querying
databases, calling APIs, or performing computations. Each tool is uniquely identified by
a name and includes metadata describing its schema.

## User Interaction Model

Tools in MCP are designed to be **model-controlled**, meaning that the language model can
discover and invoke tools automatically based on its contextual understanding and the
user's prompts.

However, implementations are free to expose tools through any interface pattern that
suits their needs -- the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user
interaction model.

> **Warning:** For trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always
> be a human in the loop with the ability to deny tool invocations.
>
> Applications **SHOULD**:
>
> - Provide UI that makes clear which tools are being exposed to the AI model
> - Insert clear visual indicators when tools are invoked
> - Present confirmation prompts to the user for operations, to ensure a human is in the
>   loop

## Capabilities

Servers that support tools **MUST** declare the `tools` capability:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": {
      "listChanged": true
    }
  }
}
```

`listChanged` indicates whether the server will emit notifications when the list of
available tools changes.

Servers that declare the `tools` capability **MUST** respond to `tools/list` requests
with the set of tools currently available to the requesting client. This set **MAY** be
empty and **MAY** change over time (see
[List Changed Notification](#list-changed-notification)), but **MUST NOT** vary
per-connection or as a side effect of other requests on the connection. The set
**MAY** vary by the authorization presented on the request -- for example, returning
only the tools the caller's granted scopes permit -- since credentials are
per-request input, not connection state.

Servers **SHOULD** return tools in a deterministic order (i.e., the same ordering across
requests when the underlying set of tools has not changed). Deterministic ordering enables
clients to reliably cache the tool list and improves LLM prompt cache hit rates when tools
are included in model context.

## Protocol Messages

### Listing Tools

To discover available tools, clients send a `tools/list` request. This operation supports
pagination and caching.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/list",
  "params": {
    "cursor": "optional-cursor-value"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "resultType": "complete",
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "title": "Weather Information Provider",
        "description": "Get current weather information for a location",
        "inputSchema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "City name or zip code"
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        },
        "icons": [
          {
            "src": "https://example.com/weather-icon.png",
            "mimeType": "image/png",
            "sizes": ["48x48"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "nextCursor": "next-page-cursor",
    "ttlMs": 300000,
    "cacheScope": "public"
  }
}
```

### Calling Tools

To invoke a tool, clients send a `tools/call` request:

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": {
      "location": "New York"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "resultType": "complete",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Current weather in New York:\nTemperature: 72°F\nConditions: Partly cloudy"
      }
    ],
    "isError": false
  }
}
```

### Input Required Tool Results

Servers **MAY** respond to `tools/call` with an `InputRequiredResult` to indicate that
additional input is needed before the tool call can be completed. This follows the
multi round-trip requests mechanism.

When retrying the request with input responses, clients include `inputResponses` and, if
provided by the server, `requestState` in the request parameters:

**Input Required Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "resultType": "input_required",
    "inputRequests": {
      "github_login": {
        "method": "elicitation/create",
        "params": {
          "mode": "form",
          "message": "Please provide your GitHub username",
          "requestedSchema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "name": { "type": "string" }
            },
            "required": ["name"]
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "requestState": "eyJsb2NhdGlvbiI6Ik5ldyBZb3JrIn0..."
  }
}
```

**Retry with Input Responses:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": {
      "location": "New York"
    },
    "inputResponses": {
      "github_login": {
        "action": "accept",
        "content": {
          "name": "octocat"
        }
      }
    },
    "requestState": "eyJsb2NhdGlvbiI6Ik5ldyBZb3JrIn0..."
  }
}
```

Note that the JSON-RPC `id` **MUST** be different between the initial request and the
retry.

### List Changed Notification

When the list of available tools changes, servers that declared the `listChanged`
capability **SHOULD** send a notification to clients that have opened a
`subscriptions/listen` stream with `toolsListChanged: true`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/tools/list_changed"
}
```

## Data Types

### Tool

A tool definition includes:

- `name`: Unique identifier for the tool
- `title`: Optional human-readable name of the tool for display purposes.
- `description`: Human-readable description of functionality
- `icons`: Optional array of icons for display in user interfaces
- `inputSchema`: JSON Schema defining expected parameters
  - Follows the JSON Schema usage guidelines
  - Defaults to 2020-12 if no `$schema` field is present
  - **MUST** be a valid JSON Schema object (not `null`)
  - For tools with no parameters, use one of these valid approaches:
    - `{ "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false }` - **Recommended**: explicitly accepts only empty objects
    - `{ "type": "object" }` - accepts any object (including with properties)
  - Properties **MAY** include an `x-mcp-header` annotation to expose
    parameter values as HTTP headers
- `outputSchema`: Optional JSON Schema defining expected output structure
  - Follows the JSON Schema usage guidelines
  - Defaults to 2020-12 if no `$schema` field is present
- `annotations`: Optional properties describing tool behavior

> **Warning:** For trust & safety and security, clients **MUST** consider tool annotations to
> be untrusted unless they come from trusted servers.

### Tool Names

- Tool names **SHOULD** be between 1 and 128 characters in length (inclusive).
- Tool names **SHOULD** be considered case-sensitive.
- The following **SHOULD** be the only allowed characters: uppercase and lowercase ASCII letters (A-Z, a-z), digits
  (0-9), underscore (\_), hyphen (-), and dot (.)
- Tool names **SHOULD NOT** contain spaces, commas, or other special characters.
- Tool names **SHOULD** be unique within a server.
- Example valid tool names:
  - `getUser`
  - `DATA_EXPORT_v2`
  - `admin.tools.list`

> **Note:** Tool name uniqueness is scoped to a single server. Clients or proxies that
> aggregate tools from multiple servers **MAY** encounter naming collisions (for
> example, two servers each exposing a `search` tool) and **SHOULD** implement a
> disambiguation strategy such as prefixing tool names with a server identifier.
>
> The server `name` (from `serverInfo`) is not guaranteed to be unique across
> servers and **SHOULD NOT** be relied upon for disambiguation.

### x-mcp-header

The `x-mcp-header` extension property allows servers to designate specific tool
parameters to be mirrored into HTTP headers when using the Streamable HTTP transport.
This enables network intermediaries (load balancers, proxies, WAFs) to route and process
requests based on parameter values without parsing the request body.

The `x-mcp-header` property is placed directly within the JSON Schema of the property to
be mirrored. Its value specifies the name portion of the resulting `Mcp-Param-{name}`
HTTP header.

**Constraints on `x-mcp-header` values:**

- **MUST NOT** be empty
- **MUST** match HTTP field-name token syntax (`1*tchar`, [RFC 9110 Section 5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-5.1))
- **MUST NOT** contain control characters, including carriage return (CR, `\r`) or
  line feed (LF, `\n`)
- **MUST** be case-insensitively unique among all `x-mcp-header` values in the
  `inputSchema`
- **MUST** only be applied to parameters with primitive types (integer, string, boolean).
  Parameters with type `number` are not permitted. Integer values **MUST** be within the
  safe range for integers represented using IEEE754 double-precision floating point numbers
  (-2^53+1 to 2^53-1)
- **MAY** be applied to properties at any nesting depth within the `inputSchema`, not
  only top-level properties

Clients using the Streamable HTTP transport **MUST** reject tool definitions where any
`x-mcp-header` value violates these constraints. Rejection means the client **MUST**
exclude the invalid tool from the result of `tools/list`. Clients **SHOULD** log a
warning when rejecting a tool definition, including the tool name and the reason for
rejection. This ensures that a single malformed tool definition does not prevent other
valid tools from being used. Clients using other transports (e.g., stdio) **MAY** ignore
`x-mcp-header` annotations entirely.

**Example tool definition with `x-mcp-header`:**

```json
{
  "name": "execute_sql",
  "description": "Execute SQL on Google Cloud Spanner",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "region": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The region to execute the query in",
        "x-mcp-header": "Region"
      },
      "query": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The SQL query to execute"
      }
    },
    "required": ["region", "query"]
  }
}
```

In this example, when the tool is called with `"region": "us-west1"`, the client adds
the header `Mcp-Param-Region: us-west1` to the HTTP request.

> **Warning:** Server developers **SHOULD NOT** mark sensitive parameters (passwords, API keys, tokens,
> PII) with `x-mcp-header`, as header values are visible to network intermediaries.

### Tool Result

Tool results may contain **structured** or **unstructured** content.

**Unstructured** content is returned in the `content` field of a result, and can contain
multiple content items of different types:

> **Note:** All content types (text, image, audio, resource links, and embedded resources)
> support optional annotations that provide metadata about audience, priority, and
> modification times. This is the same annotation format used by resources and prompts.

#### Text Content

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "Tool result text"
}
```

#### Image Content

```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "data": "base64-encoded-data",
  "mimeType": "image/png",
  "annotations": {
    "audience": ["user"],
    "priority": 0.9
  }
}
```

#### Audio Content

```json
{
  "type": "audio",
  "data": "base64-encoded-audio-data",
  "mimeType": "audio/wav"
}
```

#### Resource Links

A tool **MAY** return links to Resources, to provide additional context or data. In this
case, the tool will return a URI that can be subscribed to or fetched by the client:

```json
{
  "type": "resource_link",
  "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs",
  "name": "main.rs",
  "description": "Primary application entry point",
  "mimeType": "text/x-rust"
}
```

Resource links support the same Resource annotations as regular resources to help clients
understand how to use them.

> **Note:** Resource links returned by tools are not guaranteed to appear in the results
> of a `resources/list` request.

#### Embedded Resources

Resources **MAY** be embedded to provide additional context or data using a suitable URI
scheme. Servers that use embedded resources **SHOULD** implement the `resources`
capability:

```json
{
  "type": "resource",
  "resource": {
    "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs",
    "mimeType": "text/x-rust",
    "text": "fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello world!\");\n}",
    "annotations": {
      "audience": ["user", "assistant"],
      "priority": 0.7,
      "lastModified": "2025-05-03T14:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Embedded resources support the same Resource annotations as regular resources to help
clients understand how to use them.

#### Structured Content

**Structured** content is returned as a JSON value in the `structuredContent` field of a
result. This can be any JSON value (object, array, string, number, boolean, or null)
that conforms to the tool's `outputSchema` if one is defined.

For backwards compatibility, a tool that returns structured content SHOULD also return
the serialized JSON in a TextContent block.

#### Output Schema

Tools may also provide an output schema for validation of structured results.
If an output schema is provided:

- Servers **MUST** provide structured results that conform to this schema.
- Clients **SHOULD** validate structured results against this schema.

Example tool with output schema:

```json
{
  "name": "get_weather_data",
  "title": "Weather Data Retriever",
  "description": "Get current weather data for a location",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "City name or zip code"
      }
    },
    "required": ["location"]
  },
  "outputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "temperature": {
        "type": "number",
        "description": "Temperature in celsius"
      },
      "conditions": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Weather conditions description"
      },
      "humidity": {
        "type": "number",
        "description": "Humidity percentage"
      }
    },
    "required": ["temperature", "conditions", "humidity"]
  }
}
```

Example valid response for this tool:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 5,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "{\"temperature\": 22.5, \"conditions\": \"Partly cloudy\", \"humidity\": 65}"
      }
    ],
    "structuredContent": {
      "temperature": 22.5,
      "conditions": "Partly cloudy",
      "humidity": 65
    }
  }
}
```

Example tool with array output schema:

```json
{
  "name": "list_users",
  "title": "User List",
  "description": "Returns a list of all users",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {}
  },
  "outputSchema": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "string" },
        "name": { "type": "string" },
        "email": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["id", "name", "email"]
    }
  }
}
```

Example valid response for a tool with array output:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 6,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Found 2 users: Alice (alice@example.com) and Bob (bob@example.com)."
      }
    ],
    "structuredContent": [
      { "id": "1", "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" },
      { "id": "2", "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Providing an output schema helps clients and LLMs understand and properly handle
structured tool outputs by:

- Enabling strict schema validation of responses
- Providing type information for better integration with programming languages
- Guiding clients and LLMs to properly parse and utilize the returned data
- Supporting better documentation and developer experience

### Schema Examples

#### Tool with default 2020-12 schema:

```json
{
  "name": "calculate_sum",
  "description": "Add two numbers",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "a": { "type": "number" },
      "b": { "type": "number" }
    },
    "required": ["a", "b"]
  }
}
```

#### Tool with explicit draft-07 schema:

```json
{
  "name": "calculate_sum",
  "description": "Add two numbers",
  "inputSchema": {
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "a": { "type": "number" },
      "b": { "type": "number" }
    },
    "required": ["a", "b"]
  }
}
```

#### Tool with no parameters:

```json
{
  "name": "get_current_time",
  "description": "Returns the current server time",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

## Stateful Tools

> **Note:** This section is non-normative guidance for tool design. The protocol has no
> concept of a state handle; from the wire's perspective a handle is an ordinary
> string in a tool result and an ordinary argument to subsequent tool calls.

MCP has no protocol-level session, so a server cannot rely on implicit
per-connection state to relate one tool call to the next. Servers that need to
maintain state across calls -- a shopping cart, an open browser context, a
database transaction -- should do so by returning an explicit handle from a
creation tool and accepting that handle as an argument on subsequent calls.

For example, a server that manages a shopping cart might expose:

```jsonc
// -> tools/call
{ "name": "create_basket", "arguments": {} }

// <- result
{
  "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Created basket bsk_a1b2c3" }],
  "structuredContent": { "basket_id": "bsk_a1b2c3" }
}

// -> tools/call
{
  "name": "add_item",
  "arguments": { "basket_id": "bsk_a1b2c3", "sku": "..." }
}
```

The model is responsible for carrying `basket_id` forward; the server stores
the cart contents under that key and looks them up on each call.

When designing handles, servers should consider:

- **Authorization.** For authenticated servers, a handle is a name, not a
  capability. The server should validate the caller's authorization against the
  handle on every call. For unauthenticated servers, where the handle is
  necessarily a bearer token, it should be generated with sufficient entropy
  (e.g., a UUIDv4) and given a bounded lifetime.
- **Opacity.** Handles that encode internal structure invite parsing or
  guessing; opaque identifiers do not.
- **Lifetime.** Because handles outlive any single connection, the server's
  retention policy should be stated in the creation tool's description (e.g.,
  "baskets expire after 24 hours of inactivity") so the model can see it when
  deciding to create state.
- **Expiry errors.** A call against an expired or unknown handle should return
  a tool execution error that says so, so the model can recover by creating a
  new one.

## Error Handling

Tools use two error reporting mechanisms:

### 1. Protocol Errors

Protocol errors indicate issues with the request structure itself that models are less
likely to be able to fix:

- Unknown tool
- Malformed requests (requests that fail to satisfy CallToolRequest schema)
- Server errors

They are returned as standard JSON-RPC errors:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Unknown tool: invalid_tool_name"
  }
}
```

### 2. Tool Execution Errors

Tool execution errors contain actionable feedback that language models can use to
self-correct and retry with adjusted parameters:

- API failures
- Input validation errors (e.g., date in wrong format, value out of range)
- Business logic errors

They are reported in tool results with `isError: true`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 4,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Invalid departure date: must be in the future. Current date is 08/08/2025."
      }
    ],
    "isError": true
  }
}
```

Clients **MAY** provide protocol errors to language models, though these are less likely
to result in successful recovery. Clients **SHOULD** provide tool execution errors to
language models to enable self-correction.

## Security Considerations

1. Servers **MUST**:
   - Validate all tool inputs
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Rate limit tool invocations
   - Sanitize tool outputs

2. Clients **SHOULD**:
   - Prompt for user confirmation on sensitive operations
   - Show tool inputs to the user before calling the server, to avoid malicious or
     accidental data exfiltration
   - Validate tool results before passing to LLM
   - Follow the `$ref` resolution requirements when validating tool inputs and outputs
     against `inputSchema` and `outputSchema`
   - Implement timeouts for tool calls
   - Log tool usage for audit purposes
