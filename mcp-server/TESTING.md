uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
uv pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
```

### Execute Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_basic.py::test_create_artifact -v

# Run with coverage (if coverage installed)
pytest tests/ --cov=src/npl_mcp --cov-report=html

## Test Data Management

Tests use isolated temporary databases:
- Each test run creates `./test_data/` directory
- Database: `test_data/npl-mcp.db`
- Artifacts: `test_data/artifacts/`
- Automatic cleanup after tests complete

## Issues Fixed During Testing

### Issue 1: Async Fixture Deprecation
**Problem:** pytest-asyncio fixture warnings
**Solution:** Changed `@pytest.fixture` to `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` for async fixtures

### Issue 2: Revision Number Calculation
**Problem:** UNIQUE constraint violation when adding revisions
**Solution:** Improved NULL handling in MAX(revision_num) query:
```python
max_num = max_rev["max_num"] if max_rev and max_rev["max_num"] is not None else -1
revision_num = max_num + 1
```

### Issue 3: Datetime Deprecation
**Problem:** `datetime.utcnow()` deprecated warning
**Solution:** Changed to `datetime.now()` for timezone-naive timestamps

## Integration Test Scenarios

The tests validate complete workflows that mirror real-world usage:

### Scenario 1: Document Review Process
1. Designer creates mockup artifact
2. Developer creates review
3. Developer adds inline comments at specific lines
4. Review retrieved with all comments

### Scenario 2: Team Collaboration
1. Project manager creates chat room for team
2. Team members join automatically
3. Designer @mentions developer in message
4. Developer receives notification
5. Designer shares artifact in chat
6. All members notified of share

### Scenario 3: Task Assignment
1. PM creates todo in chat room
2. Todo assigned to specific developer
3. Developer receives notification
4. Todo appears in chat feed

## Future Test Additions

Recommended additional tests:

1. **Multi-Reviewer Tests**
   - Multiple personas reviewing same artifact
   - Generating annotated version with all comments
   - Per-reviewer comment file generation

2. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Invalid artifact IDs
   - Duplicate artifact names
   - Non-existent revisions
   - Non-member chat access

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty messages
   - Binary artifact handling
   - Large file support
   - Concurrent revision creation

4. **Script Wrapper Tests**
   - dump-files functionality
   - git-tree output
   - npl-load integration

5. **Performance Tests**
   - Large number of artifacts
   - Many revisions per artifact
   - High-volume chat rooms
   - Notification scaling

## Continuous Integration
