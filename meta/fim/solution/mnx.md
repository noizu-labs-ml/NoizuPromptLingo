# MNX (Music Notation eXtensible)

## Description
MNX is the next-generation music notation format developed by the W3C Music Notation Community Group as the future replacement for MusicXML. It provides a modern, JSON-based approach to encoding musical scores with enhanced extensibility and semantic clarity.

**Official Specification**: https://www.w3.org/2021/06/mnx

## Status
- Currently in active development by W3C Music Notation Community Group
- Designed as the successor to MusicXML
- Draft specification available, implementation support growing

## Basic Structure Example
```json
{
  "mnx": {
    "version": 1,
    "score": {
      "name": "Example Score",
      "parts": [{
        "measures": [{
          "time": { "count": 4, "unit": 4 },
          "sequences": [{
            "content": [
              { "type": "event", "duration": { "base": "quarter" }, "notes": [{ "pitch": { "octave": 4, "step": "C" } }] },
              { "type": "event", "duration": { "base": "quarter" }, "notes": [{ "pitch": { "octave": 4, "step": "E" } }] }
            ]
          }]
        }]
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

## Strengths
- **Modern Design**: Built with contemporary web technologies in mind
- **JSON Support**: Native JSON encoding alongside XML
- **Semantic Clarity**: Improved structure over MusicXML
- **Extensibility**: Designed for custom extensions and future growth
- **Web-Native**: Optimized for browser-based applications

## Limitations
- **Early Development**: Specification still evolving
- **Limited Support**: Few applications currently implement MNX
- **Conversion Tools**: Limited utilities for MusicXML to MNX migration
- **Documentation**: Reference materials still being developed

## Best For
- Future-proofing music notation projects
- Web-based music applications requiring JSON
- Projects needing extensible notation formats
- Research and experimental music notation systems

## NPL-FIM Integration
```npl
<npl-fim-mnx>
  format: "mnx-json"
  version: "1.0-draft"
  features:
    - Modern JSON-based notation
    - Semantic music structure
    - Extensible schema
    - Web-optimized encoding
  render_pipeline:
    1. Parse MNX JSON/XML structure
    2. Extract musical elements and metadata
    3. Generate NPL-FIM notation graph
    4. Apply rendering transformations
</npl-fim-mnx>
```

## Implementation Notes
- Monitor W3C Community Group for specification updates
- Consider hybrid MusicXML/MNX support during transition
- Leverage JSON schema validation for data integrity
- Plan for progressive enhancement as standard matures
