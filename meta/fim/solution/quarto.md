# Quarto - Open Scientific and Technical Publishing System

## Description
[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable JS, with dozens of output formats including HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.

## Installation & Setup
```bash
# Install via package manager (macOS/Linux)
brew install quarto  # macOS
wget https://quarto.org/download.html  # Linux

# Or download from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
```

## Basic Usage Example
```markdown
---
title: "Analysis Report"
author: "Data Science Team"
format:
  html:
    code-fold: true
execute:
  echo: true
---

## Data Analysis
Analysis of experimental results with executable code blocks.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sine Wave")
plt.show()
```

Results are automatically embedded in the output document.
```

## Strengths
- **Multi-language support**: Python, R, Julia, Observable JS in single document
- **Reproducible research**: Code execution during document generation
- **Multiple outputs**: HTML, PDF, Word, ePub, slides, websites, books
- **Scientific features**: Citations, cross-references, equations, theorems
- **Extensions**: Custom filters and formats via Lua and JavaScript
- **Version control friendly**: Plain text markdown source files

## Limitations
- Resource intensive for large computations during rendering
- Learning curve for advanced features and customization
- Requires language runtimes installed for code execution
- Limited real-time collaboration features

## Best For
- Scientific papers and technical reports
- Data analysis documentation with executable code
- Academic books and course materials
- Reproducible research workflows
- Multi-format publishing from single source
- Interactive HTML documents with Observable JS
