# MkDocs - FIM Solution Documentation

## Description
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) is a fast, simple static site generator specifically designed for building project documentation. Written in Python, it transforms Markdown files into a professional documentation website with built-in search, navigation, and theming.

## Installation & Setup
```bash
pip install mkdocs
mkdocs new my-project
cd my-project
mkdocs serve  # Development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000
mkdocs build  # Generate static site in site/
```

## Configuration (mkdocs.yml)
```yaml
site_name: My Documentation
site_url: https://example.com
theme:
  name: material  # Popular theme
  palette:
    scheme: default
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - User Guide:
    - Installation: guide/install.md
    - Configuration: guide/config.md
  - API Reference: api.md
plugins:
  - search
  - mermaid2  # Diagram support
```

## Strengths
- **Simple**: YAML configuration, Markdown content only
- **Material Theme**: Professional theme with extensive customization
- **Built-in Search**: Client-side search without external dependencies
- **Live Reload**: Auto-refresh during development
- **GitHub Pages**: Direct deployment support
- **Python Ecosystem**: Extensive plugin library

## Limitations
- **Markdown Only**: No support for RST or other formats
- **Single Language**: No native multi-language support
- **Static Only**: No dynamic content generation
- **Limited Layouts**: Fewer layout options than Sphinx

## Best Use Cases
- Open source project documentation
- API documentation with code examples
- Internal team knowledge bases
- Software user guides
- Technical tutorials

## NPL-FIM Integration
```npl
⌜mkdocs-builder|mkdocs|FIM@1.0⌝
format: markdown
config: mkdocs.yml
theme: material | readthedocs | mkdocs
plugins: [search, mermaid2, macros]
deploy: github-pages | netlify | custom
⌞mkdocs-builder⌟
```

NPL agents can generate MkDocs-ready documentation structures, automate site building, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines through FIM's documentation interface.
