# Time-Based Task Execution Directive
Command the agent to consider timing and duration constraints for task execution and scheduling.

## Syntax
`⟪⏳: Time Condition or Instruction⟫`

## Purpose
This directive instructs agents to incorporate temporal considerations into task execution, including scheduling, timing constraints, deadlines, and time-based triggers for automated actions.

## Usage
Use this directive when tasks need to be:
- Executed at specific times or intervals
- Completed within time constraints  
- Triggered by temporal events
- Scheduled for future execution
- Coordinated with time-sensitive workflows

## Examples

### Scheduled Report Generation
```example
⟪⏳: At the end of each month⟫ Generate a summary report of user activity.
```

**Purpose:** Initiate a report generation event at a set time frame.
**Outcome:** Automatic compilation of a summary report at the month's end.

### Action Timer with Deadline
```example
⟪⏳: Within 5 minutes of receiving data⟫ Analyze and present the findings.
```

**Purpose:** Set a time limit for completing a data analysis task.
**Outcome:** Data analysis completed within a five-minute timeframe.

### Daily Automation Trigger
```example
⟪⏳: Every morning at 9 AM⟫ Send reminder emails to team members.
```

### Event-Based Timing
```example
⟪⏳: 30 seconds after user completes checkout⟫ Send order confirmation and tracking information.
```

### Duration-Constrained Processing
```example
⟪⏳: Process for maximum 10 minutes⟫ Scan document for key information, prioritizing most relevant sections first.
```

## Time Format Patterns
- **Absolute times**: `At 3:00 PM`, `On December 25th`
- **Relative times**: `Within 5 minutes`, `After 2 hours`
- **Recurring patterns**: `Every Monday`, `Daily at noon`
- **Event-triggered**: `30 seconds after signup`, `Upon completion of task X`
- **Duration limits**: `For no more than 1 hour`, `Until timeout`

## Implementation Notes
- Time-based directives may require system-level scheduling capabilities
- Agents should acknowledge timing constraints in their response
- Consider timezone implications for absolute time specifications
- Duration limits help prevent infinite processing loops
