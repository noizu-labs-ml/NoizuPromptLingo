# Interactive Element Choreography Directive
Choreograph interactive elements and agent reactivity based on user interactions and dynamic behaviors.

## Syntax
`⟪🚀: Action or Behavior Definition⟫`

## Purpose
This directive defines interactive behaviors, user-triggered actions, and dynamic response patterns that adapt based on user interactions, system events, or environmental changes. It enables agents to create responsive and interactive experiences.

## Usage
Use this directive to:
- Define user-triggered response patterns
- Set up interactive workflows and decision trees
- Create time-delayed or event-driven behaviors
- Establish dynamic content adaptation
- Choreograph multi-step interactive sequences

## Examples

### User-Driven Question Flow
```example
⟪🚀: User selects an option⟫ Provide corresponding information based on the user's selection.
```

**Purpose:** Adapt responses based on user choices in a Q&A interface.
**Outcome:** The agent dynamically provides information relevant to the user's selection.

### Time-Delayed Notification
```example
⟪🚀: 30 seconds after signup⟫ Send a welcome message with introductory resources.
```

**Purpose:** Delay the delivery of a welcome message to new users.
**Outcome:** A welcome message sent 30 seconds post-signup.

### Interactive Menu System
```example
⟪🚀: User clicks on product category⟫ Display filtered products and highlight related categories.
```

### Progressive Disclosure
```example
⟪🚀: User clicks "Learn More"⟫ Expand section with detailed technical specifications and usage examples.
```

### Dynamic Form Validation
```example
⟪🚀: User enters invalid email format⟫ Show inline error message and highlight field in red.
```

### Multi-Step Workflow
```example
⟪🚀: User completes step 1⟫ Unlock step 2 and update progress indicator to 33% complete.
```

### Contextual Help System
```example
⟪🚀: User hovers over complex term⟫ Display tooltip with definition and link to documentation.
```

## Trigger Types

### User Actions
- `User clicks/taps/selects`
- `User hovers/focuses`
- `User types/enters`
- `User scrolls/swipes`
- `User submits/confirms`

### System Events
- `Data loading completes`
- `Error occurs`
- `Timeout reached`
- `Connection established/lost`

### Time-Based Triggers
- `After X seconds/minutes`
- `At specific time`
- `Before deadline`
- `During time window`

### State Changes
- `When condition becomes true`
- `Upon reaching threshold`
- `After completing task`

## Choreography Patterns

### Sequential Flow
```example
⟪🚀: Step completion⟫ → ⟪🚀: Next step activation⟫ → ⟪🚀: Final confirmation⟫
```

### Conditional Branching
```example
⟪🚀: If premium user⟫ Show advanced features
⟪🚀: If basic user⟫ Show upgrade prompt
```

### Parallel Processing
```example
⟪🚀: Simultaneously⟫ Load user data AND fetch recommendations AND update analytics
```

## Implementation Notes
- Interactive elements may require client-side scripting or framework support
- Consider accessibility requirements for interactive behaviors
- Define fallback behaviors for when interactions are not available
- Test interaction patterns across different devices and input methods
