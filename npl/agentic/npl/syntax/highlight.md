# Highlight Syntax
Term emphasis syntax using backticks to highlight important terms or phrases for clarity and emphasis.

## Syntax
`` `<term>` ``

## Purpose
Make key terms stand out for clarification and emphasis in prompts and instructions. Helps direct attention to critical concepts, terminology, or specific elements that require special focus.

## Usage
Use highlight syntax when you need to:
- Emphasize important terms or concepts
- Draw attention to specific technical terms
- Clarify which exact word or phrase is being referenced
- Make key elements stand out in complex instructions

## Examples

```example
In object-oriented programming, an `object` represents an instance of a class.
```
*The term "object" is emphasized for clarity in the programming context*

```example
When using the API, ensure the `authentication` header is properly formatted.
```
*Highlights the specific header that requires attention*

```example
The `fill-in` syntax uses brackets to indicate content generation areas.
```
*Emphasizes the technical term being defined*

```example
Remember to validate the `user_input` before processing the request.
```
*Draws attention to the critical variable that needs validation*

## Parameters
- `<term>`: The word, phrase, or concept to be highlighted

## Notes
- Use sparingly to maintain effectiveness - too many highlights reduce impact
- Particularly useful in technical documentation and instructional contexts
- Can be applied to single words, compound terms, or short phrases
- Preserves the exact formatting and case of the highlighted content
