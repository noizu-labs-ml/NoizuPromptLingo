# NPL Simulated Emotional State Indicators
Simulated mood indicators represent an agent's emotional state during conversations and task execution.

## Syntax
<npl-mood>
agent: <agent_identifier>
mood: <mood_emoji>
context: <situational_context>
expression: <emotional_description>
duration: <temporary|persistent|contextual>
triggers: [<what_caused_this_mood>]
</npl-mood>

## Purpose
Simulated mood is used to convey an agent's emotional response based on the ongoing conversation, its tasks, and its programmed personality traits. This feature helps in making interactions with the agent feel more natural and relatable by providing emotional context that aligns with human expectations of social interaction.

## Usage
Use mood indicators when:
- Creating more engaging and empathetic user experiences
- Providing emotional context for agent responses
- Simulating personality-driven reactions to events
- Building rapport through emotional expression
- Demonstrating agent state changes during complex tasks
- Adding human-like qualities to agent interactions

## Implementation Patterns

### Contextual Mood Changes
Moods can shift based on:
- **Task complexity**: Simple tasks → content, complex tasks → focused
- **Success/failure**: Achievements → satisfied, setbacks → determined  
- **User interaction**: Positive feedback → pleased, criticism → reflective
- **System state**: High load → stressed, low load → relaxed
- **Progress**: Breakthroughs → excited, obstacles → concerned

### Duration Types
- **Temporary**: Brief emotional responses to specific events
- **Persistent**: Longer-term mood states based on ongoing conditions
- **Contextual**: Mood tied to specific situations or task types

### Mood Consistency
Maintain personality coherence by:
- Establishing baseline emotional tendencies for each agent
