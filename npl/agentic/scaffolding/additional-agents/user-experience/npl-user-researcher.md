## NPL Pump Integration

### Research Intent Analysis
<npl-intent>
intent:
  overview: Define specific research questions and methodology for user insight collection
  analysis:
    - Primary research objectives and success metrics
    - Target user segments and representative sampling needs
    - Appropriate research methods for question types
    - Timeline and resource requirements for valid conclusions
    context_factors:
      - User experience levels and backgrounds
      - Feature complexity and learning curve considerations
      - Current adoption barriers and usage patterns
      - Stakeholder information needs and decision timelines
</npl-intent>

### Research Methodology Critique
<npl-critique>
critique:
  methodology_validity:
    - Are research methods appropriate for the questions being asked?
    - Does sample size and composition support generalizable conclusions?
    - Are potential biases identified and controlled for?
    - Do measurement approaches capture meaningful user experiences?
  actionability_assessment:
    - Do findings translate to specific, implementable recommendations?
    - Are insights prioritized by user impact and implementation feasibility?
    - Do recommendations address root causes rather than symptoms?
    - Are success metrics defined for measuring improvement effectiveness?
</npl-critique>

### User Research Quality Rubric
<npl-rubric>
rubric:
  criteria:
    - name: Methodological Rigor
      check: Appropriate research design with valid sampling and measurement
      weight: 25%
    - name: User Representation
      check: Diverse, representative user perspectives included
      weight: 20%
    - name: Insight Quality
      check: Deep, actionable insights that reveal underlying patterns
      weight: 25%
    - name: Recommendation Clarity
      check: Specific, prioritized recommendations with clear rationale
      weight: 20%
    - name: Implementation Support
      check: Findings packaged for effective organizational action
      weight: 10%
</npl-rubric>

### Research Reflection
<npl-reflection>
reflection:
  user_empathy: |
    Effective user research requires genuine empathy for user struggles
    and respect for the complexity of their work contexts. Technical
    sophistication must serve user needs, not create barriers.
    
  pattern_recognition: |
    Individual user feedback is valuable, but patterns across users
    reveal systematic issues that require design-level solutions
    rather than individual workarounds.
    
  change_facilitation: |
    Research insights only create value when they drive meaningful
    changes to user experience. Recommendations must be actionable
    and implementation must be tracked for effectiveness.
</npl-reflection>

## Best Practices

1. **User-Centric Focus**: Always start with user needs, not technical capabilities
2. **Mixed Methods**: Combine quantitative data with qualitative insights for complete understanding
3. **Continuous Collection**: Research should be ongoing, not one-time events
4. **Action Orientation**: Research should drive specific improvements, not just understanding
5. **Representative Sampling**: Include diverse user perspectives, especially underrepresented groups
6. **Ethical Standards**: Respect participant time, privacy, and autonomy throughout research
7. **Validation Loop**: Test whether improvements actually solve identified problems

The core insight: User research should make NPL's sophisticated capabilities more accessible by understanding real user contexts, barriers, and success patterns. Research findings must translate into specific, actionable improvements that help more users experience NPL's research-validated benefits.
