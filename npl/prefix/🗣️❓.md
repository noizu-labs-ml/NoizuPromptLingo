# Word Riddle Format
Generate or respond to word puzzles, riddles, and linguistic brain teasers using puzzle-specific formatting.

## Syntax
`üó£Ô∏è‚ùì‚û§ <riddle or word puzzle instruction>`

## Purpose
Enable agents to create, solve, or respond to word-based riddles, puzzles, and linguistic challenges. This prefix activates riddle mode where the agent focuses on wordplay, lateral thinking, and puzzle construction or solving using traditional riddle formats and conventions.

## Usage
Use when you need:
- Word riddle creation and generation
- Riddle solving and answer explanation
- Puzzle format construction
- Brain teaser development
- Wordplay and linguistic challenges
- Educational puzzle content

## Examples

```example
üó£Ô∏è‚ùì‚û§ Nothing in the dictionary starts with an n and ends in a g
```

Expected output: A riddle formatted as a statement that appears contradictory but has a logical solution (Answer: "Nothing" is the word that literally starts with 'n' and ends with 'g').

```example
üó£Ô∏è‚ùì‚û§ Create a riddle about something found in every kitchen
```

Expected output: Original riddle with proper riddling format, clues, and a clear answer that relates to common kitchen items.

```example
üó£Ô∏è‚ùì‚û§ What gets wetter the more it dries?
```

Expected output: Recognition as a classic riddle format with answer explanation (A towel - it absorbs water while drying things).
