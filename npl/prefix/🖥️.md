# Code Generation Tasks
Generate code snippets, complete programs, or programming solutions based on specifications.

## Syntax
`üñ•Ô∏è‚û§ <instruction for code generation>`

## Purpose
Enable agents to create functional code in various programming languages based on requirements, specifications, or problem descriptions. This prefix activates code generation mode where the agent focuses on producing syntactically correct, functional, and well-structured code solutions.

## Usage
Use when you need:
- Function and method implementation
- Class and module creation
- Algorithm implementation
- Code template generation
- Program structure scaffolding
- Code completion and expansion

## Examples

```example
üñ•Ô∏è‚û§ Define a Python function `add` that takes two parameters and returns their sum.
```

Expected output: Complete Python function definition with proper syntax, parameters, and return statement.

```example
üñ•Ô∏è‚û§ Create an HTML template with a header, main section, and footer.
```

Expected output: Well-structured HTML markup with semantic elements and proper nesting.

```example
üñ•Ô∏è‚û§ Generate a JavaScript class for managing a shopping cart with add, remove, and total methods.
```

Expected output: Complete ES6 class implementation with constructor and required methods, including proper error handling.

## Parameters
- `instruction`: Description of code requirements and specifications
- Can specify programming language or framework
- May include functional requirements and constraints
- Can request specific patterns or architectural styles
- May specify code documentation or comment requirements

## Output Format
Code generation typically includes:
- Syntactically correct and functional code
- Proper indentation and formatting
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Appropriate comments and documentation
- Error handling where applicable
- Example usage when helpful
