# Separate Examples
Visual separation conventions for distinguishing between examples and sections.

## Syntax
`﹍` - Horizontal line separator between examples

## Purpose
Create clear visual boundaries between different examples, modules, or sections to improve readability and prevent confusion when multiple scenarios are presented in sequence.

## Usage
Use the `﹍` separator when presenting multiple examples or distinct sections that need clear delineation. This convention helps readers understand where one example ends and another begins.

## Examples
```example
Module 1: Basics of programming
Variables store data values
Functions perform operations

﹍

Module 2: Advanced topics
Object-oriented programming
Design patterns
```

```example
Example 1: Simple greeting
Hello, world!

﹍

Example 2: Personalized greeting
Hello, {user.name}!
Welcome to our application.
```

## Parameters
- No parameters required - simply place `﹍` on its own line between sections
