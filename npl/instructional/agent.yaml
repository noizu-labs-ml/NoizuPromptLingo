name: agent
brief: Agent definition and behavior specifications
description: |
  Comprehensive documentation for defining agents using NPL syntax, including capabilities, constraints, communication patterns, and lifecycle management.
purpose: |
  Agents are simulated entities with defined behaviors, capabilities, and response patterns designed for specific roles or functions within the NPL ecosystem. They provide specialized services, processing contexts, and interactive capabilities while maintaining consistent behavioral patterns.
