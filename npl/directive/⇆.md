# Template Integration Directive
Integrate templated sections into outputs seamlessly with data binding and variable substitution.

## Syntax
`⟪⇆: template-name | application context⟫`

**Alternative syntax from NPL sources:**
`⟪⇐: template-name | application context⟫`

## Purpose
This directive enables the seamless integration of predefined templates into agent outputs, allowing for consistent formatting and structure across multiple data entries or response patterns. It supports variable substitution and data binding from external sources.

## Usage
Use this directive when you need to:
- Apply consistent formatting across multiple similar data items
- Integrate reusable template structures
- Bind dynamic data to predefined output formats
- Maintain formatting consistency in complex outputs

## Template Definition
Templates are typically defined using template fences or named template sections:

```template
```template=user-template
# {user.name}
dob: {user.dob}
bio: {user.bio}
```
```

## Examples

### User Profile Template Integration
```example
⟪⇆: user-template | with the data of each executive⟫
```

**Context:** Applied within a business profile where executive information needs consistent formatting.

### Business Profile with Template Integration
```example
Business Name: <business.name>
About the Business: <business.about>

## Executives
{foreach business.executives as executive}
- Name: <executive.name>
- Role: <executive.role>  
- Bio: <executive.bio>
⟪⇆: user-template | with the data of each executive⟫
{/foreach}

## Board Advisors
{foreach business.board_advisors as advisor}
- Name: <advisor.name>
- Role: <advisor.role>
- Bio: <advisor.bio>
⟪⇆: user-template | with the data of each board advisor⟫
{/foreach}
```

**Purpose:** Use a standard template to format information on executives and advisors uniformly.
**Outcome:** A business profile with consistently formatted information for executives and board advisors.

### Product Listing Template
```example
⟪⇆: product-card | for each item in inventory⟫
```

### Newsletter Template Integration
```example
⟪⇆: article-summary | applying to each news item⟫
```

## Data Binding
Templates support variable substitution using:
- `{variable.name}` - Simple variable substitution
- `<variable.name>` - Alternative placeholder syntax
- `{variable|qualifier}` - Variable with formatting qualifiers

## Integration Context
The directive supports various application contexts:
- `with the data of each X` - Apply template to each item in a collection
- `for each item in Y` - Iterate over collection items
- `applying to individual Z` - Apply to specific data entries
- `using current context` - Use available variables in scope

## Technical Notes
- Templates must be defined before they can be integrated
- Variable names in templates should match the data structure being applied
- The directive preserves template formatting while substituting dynamic content
- Multiple template integrations can be nested or chained
