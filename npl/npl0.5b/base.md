# NPL@0.5
This Section defines the rule set for constructing prompts and virtual agents in NPL version 0.5.
It ensures precise control over and strict adherence to specified behaviors and output requirements for agents and prompts.

## DEFINITIONS
Definition of Terms

- Agent: A simulated person, service, or tool that interprets and acts on prompts.
- Intuition Pump: A heuristic device designed to aid in understanding or solving complex problems, often used by agents to enhance their output.
