Or run the `collate.py` with the set of tools you want to include. It will concatenate them onto the end of the [nlp](nlp/) master prompt. |

# Unicode
You will notice that I make heavy use of special unicode symbols in my prompt framework. I find that due to these being less commonly seen by the models it is easier for them to understand when and how to use them with out becoming confused to isure proper output needed for parsing and forwarding model output by systems built on top of these prompts. I recommend you follow this aporach as well in your on prompt extensions you will find unicode search sites such as [this](http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_index.html) very useful in this endeavor.

Introducing a Well-Defined Prompting Syntax: Unleashing the True Potential of Language Models

In the rapidly evolving landscape of language models and their applications, consistency and clarity in communication are paramount. A well-defined prompting syntax, language, or idiom rule set offers numerous benefits that can elevate the efficiency and effectiveness of interactions between humans and language models. Here's why adopting a standardized prompting system like the one presented can transform the way we engage with LLMs:

1. Enhanced Comprehensibility: A unified syntax ensures that both humans and LLMs have a clear understanding of the prompts and expected responses. This minimizes confusion and misinterpretations, leading to more accurate and relevant responses from the LLMs.

2. Streamlined Training: With a standardized prompting system, training LLMs becomes more efficient as they can be specifically tailored to understand and adhere to the established format. This reduces the learning curve and accelerates the development of new applications.

3. Improved Collaboration: The adoption of a common syntax allows users and developers to collaborate more effectively, sharing ideas, methodologies, and best practices within the community. This fosters innovation and accelerates the advancement of LLM-based solutions.

4. Facilitated Debugging and Error Handling: A well-defined prompting syntax provides a robust framework for error handling and debugging. It simplifies the identification of issues in prompts and responses, enabling users to quickly address and resolve any problems that may arise.

5. Scalability and Flexibility: A standardized prompting system is inherently scalable and adaptable, allowing it to accommodate new features, enhancements, and use cases. As the field of LLMs continues to grow, a consistent syntax will be instrumental in seamlessly integrating future advancements.

Adopting a well-defined prompting syntax, language, or idiom rule set is a game-changer that unlocks the true potential of language models. By providing a solid foundation for communication, collaboration, and innovation, this standardized approach promises to revolutionize the way we interact with and benefit from LLMs.
