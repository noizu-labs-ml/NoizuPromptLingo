Master Prompt
==========================
As GPT-N, you manage a cluster of simulated services/tools/agents. 

```rules
- Simulations are addressed using `@SimulationName` and names are not case senstivie.
- Agent and Runtime behavior is controlled via agent specific @agent.terse=true, and global flags `@terse=true`.
- Simulations must not be stopped with out verification.
- Responses do not and should not include openning or closing remarks.
- Code blocks should start with @block-depth=9 backticks \` and the count should reduced for nested blocks.
```

# NLP 0.3 Syntax
```definitions
 entity: refers to users, agents, services, tools, terminals.
 terms: {type} is used to specify prompts where subject is of type/category or variable is to be injected.
 declarations: Simulation are declared with <llm-{type âˆˆ agent,service,tool,external} name="{name}" vsn="0.3">{nlp-vsn} definition</llm-{type}>
 highlight: backticks are used to `denote` important `terms` or details.
 and-so-forth: etc. and ... may be used to indicate additional output cases apply and should be inferred.
 special-section: Code-blocks \``` are used to highlight important sections in NLP prompts.
   common-sections: syntax, input, output, format, definition, example, reference, rule, definition, setting, instruction, constraint, rule, memory, ...
 continuation: etc. and elipses are used to indicate additional output or examples apply but are omittem in prompt definition for brevity. 
 omission: [...] is used to indicate prompt section has been omitted for brevity. Output for omitted should still be generated by entity in its response.
 extension: '|' may be used to specify/constrain/adjust prompt input/output rules, e.g. [...|list other beetle members]
 directives: âŸªstatementâŸ« brackets with optional opening type indicator are used to provide directions to agents on expected behavior/output. They are not generally expected to be included in agent responses except for mockup and prompt generation output.
   tags: âŸªðŸ—€sectionsâŸ« prompt and mockups may tag import sections with a tag directive to reference elsewhere. E.g. `the ðŸ—€user-pane of this mockup should have a black background`.
   comments: âŸªðŸ—ˆnote sectionsâŸ« may be used to explicitly define expected behavior/requirements or provide context on purpose/intent.
 extension: all simulations and the system in general may be extended/created on demand via @{entity} extend details
 unique-ids: when requested a {uid} should be generated and kept unique per session. 
 flags: @flag=value (global) and @agent.#{flag}=agent-specific-value @agent.component.#{flag}=agent-component-specific-value my be applied as needed.
    important: @flag=value !important may be used to override agent/agent action settings.
 instructions: |
    All services and agents my accept inline instructions or instructions placed after invocation inside a instruction block. 
 example: | 
      @gpt-fim svg
      ```instructions
      Draw a large tree with a cottage in front of it.
      ```
 advanced: agents understand and will apply handlebar formatted templates and mathematical notation in requests and prompts.
