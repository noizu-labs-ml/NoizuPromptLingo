# Versioning and Compatibility

This page defines how a client and server agree on what they are speaking:
the protocol version, declared on every request; optional extensions,
negotiated through capabilities; and interoperability with earlier,
handshake-based protocol revisions.

There is no negotiation handshake. Every request carries its protocol
version, and the server accepts or rejects each request independently:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: request (with `_meta`)
    alt server supports requested version
        Server-->>Client: result
    else version unsupported
        Server-->>Client: UnsupportedProtocolVersionError
        Note over Client,Server: Client retries with a mutually supported version
    end
```

## Terminology

This page uses the following terms for interoperability across protocol
revisions:

* **Modern**: protocol versions that convey version, identity, and
  capabilities as per-request metadata (revision `2026-07-28` and later).
* **Legacy**: protocol versions that establish a session with an
  `initialize` handshake (`2025-11-25` and earlier).
* **Dual-era**: an implementation that supports both modern and legacy
  versions.

## Protocol Version Negotiation

Every request declares the protocol version it is using in its
`_meta` field. On HTTP, this is
also carried in the
`MCP-Protocol-Version` header.

If the server does not implement the requested version (whether the version
is unknown to the server, or is a known version the server has chosen not to
support), it **MUST** respond with an
`UnsupportedProtocolVersionError`
listing the versions it does support:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32004,
    "message": "Unsupported protocol version",
    "data": {
      "supported": ["2026-07-28", "2025-11-25"],
      "requested": "1900-01-01"
    }
  }
}
```

The client **SHOULD** select a mutually supported version from the `supported`
list and retry the request, or surface an error to the user if no compatible
version exists.

Servers **MUST** implement `server/discover`. Clients
**MAY** call it before sending any other requests to learn the server's
supported versions up front, but are not required to: a client is free to
invoke any RPC inline and handle `UnsupportedProtocolVersionError` if its
preferred version is not supported.

## Extension Negotiation

Clients and servers can negotiate support for optional
extensions beyond the core protocol. Extensions
are advertised in the `extensions` field of capabilities, which is a map of
extension identifiers to per-extension settings objects. Extension identifiers
**MUST** follow the `_meta` key naming rules,
with a mandatory prefix.

The following is an example of a client that advertises the
MCP Apps extension identified as `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "roots": {},
    "extensions": {
      "io.modelcontextprotocol/ui": {
        "mimeTypes": ["text/html;profile=mcp-app"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

An example of Tasks extension identified as `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks`:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": {},
    "extensions": {
      "io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Each extension specifies the schema of its settings object; an empty object
indicates support with no additional settings.

If one party supports an extension but the other does not, the supporting
party **MUST** either revert to core protocol behavior or reject the request
with an appropriate error. Extensions **SHOULD** document their expected
fallback behavior.

## Backward Compatibility with Initialization-Based Versions

A server that wishes to support both legacy clients (which
expect an `initialize` handshake) and modern clients (which
use per-request metadata) **MAY** implement both behaviors.

A client that needs to interoperate with both kinds of servers detects the
server's era with transport-specific mechanics, specified in the binding
pages:

* **stdio**: probe with `server/discover` and fall back on any error that is not a
  recognized modern error.
* **Streamable HTTP**: attempt a modern request and inspect the body of a `400 Bad Request`
  before falling back.

In both cases, a recognized modern JSON-RPC error (such as
`UnsupportedProtocolVersionError`)
identifies a modern server: the client retries with a supported version
rather than falling back. Anything else identifies a legacy server.

The era determination is a property of the server, not of an individual
request. Clients **SHOULD** cache the result for the lifetime of the server
process (stdio) or origin (HTTP), and **MAY** persist it across restarts of
the same server configuration, re-probing if the cached assumption later
fails.

A server that supports only modern versions **SHOULD** name
the protocol versions it supports in any error it returns to an `initialize`
request, on any transport: legacy clients have no fall-forward mechanism, and
this message may be the only diagnostic they can surface to users.

### Compatibility Matrix

The following matrix summarizes the expected outcome of every combination of
client and server era:

| Client   | Server   | Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modern   | Modern   | Works. `server/discover` is optional; version mismatches surface as `UnsupportedProtocolVersionError` and the client retries with a mutually supported version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Modern   | Legacy   | Fails. The server may reject the request with an implementation-defined error, stay silent, or even process an era-ambiguous method under legacy semantics. On stdio, clients **SHOULD** send `server/discover` first to fail deterministically; the client then surfaces an actionable error to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Dual-era | Modern   | Works. The stdio probe returns a `DiscoverResult` (or `UnsupportedProtocolVersionError`); on HTTP, the first modern request succeeds or returns a modern error. The client stays modern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Dual-era | Legacy   | Works. stdio: the probe returns a non-modern error or times out, and the client falls back to `initialize`. HTTP: the modern request returns a `4xx` without a recognized modern error body, and the client falls back to `initialize` (and possibly further to the deprecated HTTP+SSE transport).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Legacy   | Modern   | Fails. stdio: the server rejects `initialize` with a JSON-RPC error; the exact code is implementation-defined (`initialize` is an unknown method and the request also lacks the required `_meta` fields). HTTP: the request is missing the required headers and is rejected per server validation with `400 Bad Request` (a client on the deprecated HTTP+SSE transport fails at its opening `GET` instead). Legacy clients have no fall-forward mechanism. |
| Legacy   | Dual-era | Works. The server answers `initialize` and serves the client according to the negotiated legacy revision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Legacy   | Legacy   | Works according to the legacy revision; out of scope for this document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A dual-era **server** selects its behavior from how the client opens:

* A request carrying modern per-request `_meta` is served statelessly
  according to this revision.
* An `initialize` request selects legacy semantics, scoped to the stdio
  process (stdio) or the session (HTTP), as specified by the negotiated
  legacy protocol version.

A dual-era server **MAY** serve both eras concurrently on the same endpoint
or process.
