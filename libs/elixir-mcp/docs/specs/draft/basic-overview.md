# Overview

The Model Context Protocol consists of several key components that work together:

* **Base Protocol**: Core JSON-RPC message types
* **Versioning and Compatibility**: Protocol version negotiation, extension negotiation, and interoperability with earlier protocol revisions
* **Message Patterns**: Messaging patterns supported by the core protocol including request and response, multi round-trip requests (MRTR), and subscribe and notify
* **Authorization**: Authentication and authorization framework for HTTP-based transports
* **Server Features**: Resources, prompts, and tools exposed by servers
* **Client Features**: Elicitation, sampling and root directory lists provided by clients
* **Utilities**: Cross-cutting concerns like logging and argument completion

All implementations **MUST** support the base protocol, versioning,
and the message patterns. Other components **MAY** be implemented based on the specific needs of the
application.

These protocol layers establish clear separation of concerns while enabling rich
interactions between clients and servers. The modular design allows implementations to
support exactly the features they need.

## Messages

All messages between MCP clients and servers **MUST** follow the
[JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification. The protocol defines
these types of messages:

### Requests

Requests are sent from the client to the server, to initiate an operation.

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id: string | number;
  method: string;
  params?: {
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
}
```

* Requests **MUST** include a string or integer ID.
* Unlike base JSON-RPC, the ID **MUST NOT** be `null`.
* The request ID **MUST NOT** match the ID of any other request the sender has issued and
  not yet received a response for.

### Responses

Responses are sent in reply to requests, containing either the result or error of the operation.

#### Result Responses

Result responses are sent when the operation completes successfully.

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id: string | number;
  result: {
    resultType: string;
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
}
```

* Result responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to.
* Result responses **MUST** include a `result` field.
* The `result` **MAY** follow any JSON object structure.
* The `result` **MUST** include a `resultType` field to indicate the type of the result.

##### ResultType

The `resultType` field in a result indicates the type of the result being returned. MCP supports polymorphic result types,
allowing servers to return different structures based on the outcome of the request. The `resultType` field is a string that clients
can use to determine how to parse and handle the `result` object.

* A `resultType` of `"complete"` indicates the request completed successfully and the result contains the final content.
* A `resultType` of `"input_required"` indicates the request is incomplete and more information is needed to process the request. The result contains an `InputRequiredResult` object with additional information needed.
* Extensions **MAY** add additional `ResultType` values. The set of supported `ResultType` values **MUST** be created from the set defined in the core protocol and include any additional values of supported extensions that are advertised via capabilities.
* A `resultType` of any value unrecognized by the client **MUST** be considered invalid.
* For backward compatibility with servers implementing earlier protocol versions, which do not include `resultType`, clients **MUST** treat an absent `resultType` as `"complete"`.

#### Error Responses

Error responses are sent when the operation fails or encounters an error.

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id?: string | number;
  error: {
    code: number;
    message: string;
    data?: unknown;
  }
}
```

* Error responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to (except in error cases where the ID could not be read due a malformed request).
* Error responses **MUST** include an `error` field with a `code` and `message`.
* Error codes **MUST** be integers.

### Notifications

Notifications are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, as a one-way message.
The receiver **MUST NOT** send a response.

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: string;
  params?: {
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
}
```

* Notifications **MUST NOT** include an ID.

### Message Patterns

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) supports several Message Patterns that define how clients and servers interact:

1. **Request and Response**: A client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with a result or error.
2. **Multi Round-Trip Requests (MRTR)**: A server requires additional client input (sampling, elicitation, or roots) to complete a request.
3. **Subscribe and Notify**: A client subscribes to a stream of notifications from the server, which are sent as they occur.

## Statelessness

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a **stateless protocol**: all the
information needed to process a request is contained in the request itself.
A server processes each request independently; no state should be inferred
from previous requests, even those on the same connection or stream.

Specifically:

* Servers **MUST NOT** rely on prior requests over the same connection to
  establish context (e.g., capabilities, protocol version, client identity).
  Every request supplies this metadata in its `_meta` field.
* Servers **SHOULD** be prepared to handle requests associated with multiple
  tasks, threads, or conversations.
* Servers **SHOULD NOT** require that a client reuse the same connection or process to
  perform related operations.
* Clients **SHOULD NOT** use an individual task, thread, or conversation as the
  lifetime boundary for the stdio process.
* State that needs to span multiple requests (e.g., long-running tasks,
  application-level handles) **MUST** be referenced by an explicit identifier
  the client passes on each request.

> **Note:** This implies that an open connection, such as a STDIO process, is not a
> conversation or session: clients may interleave unrelated requests on the same
> transport, and a server must not treat connection or process identity as a
> proxy for conversation or session continuity.

Long-lived requests like `subscriptions/listen` remain request/response; the response is just an open stream of notifications.
Their state is scoped to the request itself, not to the connection underneath.

## Auth

MCP provides an Authorization framework for use with HTTP.
Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification,
whereas implementations using STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification,
and instead retrieve credentials from the environment.

Additionally, clients and servers **MAY** negotiate their own custom authentication and
authorization strategies.

## Schema

The full specification of the protocol is defined as a
[TypeScript schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/draft/schema.ts).
This is the source of truth for all protocol messages and structures.

There is also a
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/draft/schema.json),
which is automatically generated from the TypeScript source of truth, for use with
various automated tooling.

## JSON Schema Usage

The Model Context Protocol uses JSON Schema for validation throughout the protocol. This section clarifies how JSON Schema should be used within MCP messages.

### Schema Dialect

MCP supports JSON Schema with the following rules:

1. **Default dialect**: When a schema does not include a `$schema` field, it defaults to [JSON Schema 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema)
2. **Explicit dialect**: Schemas MAY include a `$schema` field to specify a different dialect
3. **Supported dialects**: Implementations MUST support at least 2020-12 and SHOULD document which additional dialects they support
4. **Recommendation**: Implementors are RECOMMENDED to use JSON Schema 2020-12.

### Example Usage

#### Default dialect (2020-12):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "age": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 0 }
  },
  "required": ["name"]
}
```

#### Explicit dialect (draft-07):

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "age": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 0 }
  },
  "required": ["name"]
}
```

### Implementation Requirements

* Clients and servers **MUST** support JSON Schema 2020-12 for schemas without an explicit `$schema` field
* Clients and servers **MUST** validate schemas according to their declared or default dialect. They **MUST** handle unsupported dialects gracefully by returning an appropriate error indicating the dialect is not supported.
* Clients and servers **SHOULD** document which schema dialects they support

### Schema Validation

* Schemas **MUST** be valid according to their declared or default dialect

### `$ref` Resolution

JSON Schema 2020-12 permits `$ref` to point at an absolute URI. Implementations **MUST NOT**
automatically dereference `$ref` values that resolve to a network URI.

Implementations **MAY** offer an opt-in mode that fetches non-local `$ref`s but it
**MUST** be disabled by default and **SHOULD** enforce an allowlist of hosts or at
minimum reject loopback, link-local, and private network addresses, apply timeouts and
size limits, and log dereferenced URIs.

Schemas that fail to validate due to an unresolved external `$ref` **SHOULD** be rejected
rather than silently treated as permissive.

### Composition-Keyword Resource Use

Composition keywords (`anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf`, `if`/`then`/`else`) and `$defs` enable
expressive schemas but can be expensive to validate. Implementations **SHOULD** apply
reasonable bounds, such as a maximum schema depth, a cap on the total number of subschemas,
or a per-validation time budget, to prevent a malicious schema from acting as a Denial-of-Service
vector against the validator.

## General fields

### `_meta`

The `_meta` property/parameter is reserved by MCP to allow clients and servers
to attach additional metadata to their interactions.

Certain key names are reserved by MCP for protocol-level metadata, as specified below;
implementations MUST NOT make assumptions about values at these keys.

Additionally, definitions in the schema
may reserve particular names for purpose-specific metadata, as declared in those definitions.

**Key name format:** valid `_meta` key names have two segments: an optional **prefix**, and a **name**.

**Prefix:**

* If specified, MUST be a series of labels separated by dots (`.`), followed by a slash (`/`).
  * Labels MUST start with a letter and end with a letter or digit; interior characters can be letters, digits, or hyphens (`-`).
  * Implementations SHOULD use reverse DNS notation (e.g., `com.example/` rather than `example.com/`).
* Any prefix where the second label is `modelcontextprotocol` or `mcp` is **reserved** for MCP use.
  * For example: `io.modelcontextprotocol/`, `dev.mcp/`, `org.modelcontextprotocol.api/`, and `com.mcp.tools/` are all reserved.
  * However, `com.example.mcp/` is NOT reserved, as the second label is `example`.

**Name:**

* Unless empty, MUST begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`).
* MAY contain hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics in between.

**Per-request protocol fields:**

Every client request **MUST** include the following `io.modelcontextprotocol/*` fields
in `_meta`. Servers use these to identify the client and the protocol version in use
without relying on any prior connection state. See
Versioning and Compatibility for version negotiation rules.

| Key                                          | Type                 | Required | Description                                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion`    | `string`             | Yes      | Protocol version for this request (e.g., `"2026-07-28"`)  |
| `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientInfo`         | `Implementation`     | Yes      | Client name and version                                   |
| `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities` | `ClientCapabilities` | Yes      | Client capabilities relevant to this request              |
| `io.modelcontextprotocol/logLevel`           | `LoggingLevel`       | No       | Minimum log level the server should emit for this request |

A request missing any required field is malformed; the server **MUST** reject it with
JSON-RPC error code `-32602` (Invalid params). On HTTP, the response status **MUST** be
`400 Bad Request`.

A server **MUST NOT** rely on capabilities the client has not declared. If
processing a request requires a capability the client did not include in
`io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities`, the server **MUST** return a
`MissingRequiredClientCapabilityError` (`-32003`) whose `data.requiredCapabilities` lists the missing capabilities. On
HTTP, the response status **MUST** be `400 Bad Request`.

On notifications delivered via a `subscriptions/listen` stream,
the server **MUST** include `io.modelcontextprotocol/subscriptionId` in `_meta` so the
client can correlate the notification with the originating subscription request.

**OpenTelemetry trace context:**

As an exception to the prefix requirement above, the keys `traceparent`, `tracestate`, and
`baggage` are reserved for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) trace context propagation.
When present, their values MUST follow [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/)
and [W3C Baggage](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/) formats respectively.

This exception exists to maintain compatibility with existing implementations and
[OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for MCP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/mcp/).

Non-normative example of trace context in `_meta`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": {
      "location": "New York"
    },
    "_meta": {
      "traceparent": "00-0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c-00f067aa0ba902b7-01"
    }
  }
}
```

### `icons`

The `icons` property provides a standardized way for servers to expose visual identifiers for their resources, tools, prompts, and implementations. Icons enhance user interfaces by providing visual context and improving the discoverability of available functionality.

Icons are represented as an array of `Icon` objects, where each icon includes:

* `src`: A URI pointing to the icon resource (required). This can be:
  * An HTTP/HTTPS URL pointing to an image file
  * A data URI with base64-encoded image data
* `mimeType`: Optional MIME type if the server's type is missing or generic
* `sizes`: Optional array of size specifications (e.g., `["48x48"]`, `["any"]` for scalable formats like SVG, or `["48x48", "96x96"]` for multiple sizes)
* `theme`: Optional theme preference (`light` or `dark`) for the icon background

**Required MIME type support:**

Clients that support rendering icons **MUST** support at least the following MIME types:

* `image/png` - PNG images (safe, universal compatibility)
* `image/jpeg` (and `image/jpg`) - JPEG images (safe, universal compatibility)

Clients that support rendering icons **SHOULD** also support:

* `image/svg+xml` - SVG images (scalable but requires security precautions as noted below)
* `image/webp` - WebP images (modern, efficient format)

**Security considerations:**

Consumers of icon metadata **MUST** take appropriate security precautions when handling icons to prevent compromise:

* Treat icon metadata and icon bytes as untrusted inputs and defend against network, privacy, and parsing risks.
* Ensure that the icon URI is either a HTTPS or `data:` URI. Clients **MUST** reject icon URIs that use unsafe schemes and redirects, such as `javascript:`, `file:`, `ftp:`, `ws:`, or local app URI schemes.
  * Disallow scheme changes and redirects to hosts on different origins.
* Be resilient against resource exhaustion attacks stemming from oversized images, large dimensions, or excessive frames (e.g., in GIFs).
  * Consumers **MAY** set limits for image and content size.
* Fetch icons without credentials. Do not send cookies, `Authorization` headers, or client credentials.
* Verify that icon URIs are from the same origin as the server. This minimizes the risk of exposing data or tracking information to third-parties.
* Exercise caution when fetching and rendering icons as the payload **MAY** contain executable content (e.g., SVG with embedded JavaScript or extended capabilities).
  * Consumers **MAY** choose to disallow specific file types or otherwise sanitize icon files before rendering.
* Validate MIME types and file contents before rendering. Treat the MIME type information as advisory. Detect content type via magic bytes; reject on mismatch or unknown types.
  * Maintain a strict allowlist of image types.

**Usage:**

Icons can be attached to:

* `Implementation`: Visual identifier for the MCP server/client implementation
* `Tool`: Visual representation of the tool's functionality
* `Prompt`: Icon to display alongside prompt templates
* `Resource`: Visual indicator for different resource types

Multiple icons can be provided to support different display contexts and resolutions. Clients should select the most appropriate icon based on their UI requirements.
