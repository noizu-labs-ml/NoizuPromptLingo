# Authorization

## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

The Model Context Protocol provides authorization capabilities at the transport level,
enabling MCP clients to make requests to restricted MCP servers on behalf of resource
owners. This specification defines the authorization flow for HTTP-based transports.

### Protocol Requirements

Authorization is **OPTIONAL** for MCP implementations. When supported:

* Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification.
* Implementations using an STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification, and
  instead retrieve credentials from the environment.
* Implementations using alternative transports **MUST** follow established security best
  practices for their protocol.

### Standards Compliance

This authorization mechanism is based on established specifications listed below, but
implements a selected subset of their features to ensure security and interoperability
while maintaining simplicity:

* OAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT ([draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13))
* OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage
  ([RFC6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750))
* OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata
  ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))
* OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol
  ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591))
* Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0
  ([RFC8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html))
* OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))
* OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identification ([RFC9207](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207))
* OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents ([draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00))
* [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)
* OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 ([OpenID Connect Registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html))

## Roles

A protected *MCP server* acts as an [OAuth 2.1 resource server](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#name-roles),
capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

An *MCP client* acts as an [OAuth 2.1 client](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#name-roles),
making protected resource requests on behalf of a resource owner.

The *authorization server* is responsible for interacting with the user (if necessary) and issuing access tokens for use at the MCP server.
The implementation details of the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification. It may be hosted with the
resource server or a separate entity. [Authorization Server Discovery](./basic-authorization-server-discovery.md)
specifies how an MCP server indicates the location of its corresponding authorization server to a client.

## Overview

1. Authorization servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.1 with appropriate security
   measures for both confidential and public clients.

2. Authorization servers and MCP clients **SHOULD** support [OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents](./basic-authorization-client-registration.md#client-id-metadata-documents)
   ([draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00)).

3. Authorization servers and MCP clients **MAY** support the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration
   Protocol ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)). Note that
   [Dynamic Client Registration](./basic-authorization-client-registration.md#dynamic-client-registration)
   is deprecated and retained for backwards compatibility with authorization servers that do not support Client ID Metadata Documents.

4. MCP servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)).
   MCP clients **MUST** use OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata for [authorization server discovery](./basic-authorization-server-discovery.md).

5. MCP authorization servers **MUST** provide at least one of the following discovery mechanisms:

   * OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))
   * [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)

   MCP clients **MUST** support both [discovery mechanisms](./basic-authorization-server-discovery.md#authorization-server-metadata-discovery) to obtain the information required to interact with the authorization server.

## Authorization Server Discovery

MCP servers advertise their associated authorization servers through OAuth 2.0 Protected
Resource Metadata, and MCP clients determine authorization server endpoints and supported
capabilities through authorization server metadata discovery. Implementations **MUST**
follow the normative discovery requirements defined in
[Authorization Server Discovery](./basic-authorization-server-discovery.md).

## Client Registration

Before initiating the authorization flow, MCP clients **MUST** obtain a client ID through
one of three registration mechanisms: Client ID Metadata Documents, pre-registration, or
Dynamic Client Registration, following the requirements and selection priority defined in
[Client Registration](./basic-authorization-client-registration.md).

## Scope Selection Strategy

MCP servers **SHOULD** include a `scope` parameter in the `WWW-Authenticate` header as defined in
[RFC 6750 Section 3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3)
to indicate the scopes required for accessing the resource. This provides clients with immediate
guidance on the appropriate scopes to request during authorization,
following the principle of least privilege and preventing clients from requesting excessive permissions.

The scopes included in the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge **MAY** match `scopes_supported`, be a subset
or superset of it, or an alternative collection that is neither a strict subset nor
superset. Clients **MUST NOT** assume any particular set relationship between the challenged
scope set and `scopes_supported`. Clients **MUST** treat the scopes provided in the
challenge as authoritative for the current operation. These scopes are required to
satisfy the current request. When re-authorizing, clients **SHOULD** include these scopes
alongside any previously granted scopes to avoid losing permissions needed for other operations
(see [Step-Up Authorization Flow](#step-up-authorization-flow)). Servers **SHOULD** strive for
consistency in how they construct scope sets but they are not required to surface every dynamically
issued scope through `scopes_supported`.

Example 401 response with scope guidance:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource",
                         scope="files:read"
```

When implementing authorization flows, MCP clients **SHOULD** follow the principle of least privilege by requesting
only the scopes necessary for their intended operations. During the initial authorization handshake, MCP clients
**SHOULD** follow this priority order for scope selection:

1. **Use `scope` parameter** from the initial `WWW-Authenticate` header in the 401 response, if provided
2. **If `scope` is not available**, use all scopes defined in `scopes_supported` from the Protected Resource Metadata document, omitting the `scope` parameter if `scopes_supported` is undefined.

This approach accommodates the general-purpose nature of MCP clients, which typically lack domain-specific knowledge to make informed decisions about individual scope selection. Requesting all available scopes allows the authorization server and end-user to determine appropriate permissions during the consent process.

This approach minimizes user friction while following the principle of least privilege.
The `scopes_supported` field is intended to represent the minimal set of scopes necessary
for basic functionality (see [Scope Minimization](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/security/security_best_practices#scope-minimization)),
with additional scopes requested incrementally through the step-up authorization flow steps
described in the [Scope Challenge Handling](#scope-challenge-handling) section.

## Authorization Flow Steps

The registration step shown in the flow uses one of the mechanisms defined in
[Client Registration](./basic-authorization-client-registration.md).

The complete Authorization flow proceeds as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)
    participant C as Client
    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)
    participant A as Authorization Server

    C->>M: MCP request without token

    C->>M: MCP request with access token
    M-->>C: MCP response
    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token
```

### Authorization Response Validation

Before redirecting the user-agent, the client **MUST** record the `issuer` value from the selected authorization server's validated metadata document (see [Authorization Server Metadata Discovery](./basic-authorization-server-discovery.md#authorization-server-metadata-discovery)) and associate it with the same per-request record used to store the PKCE code verifier (and the `state` value, if used). The validation in this section depends on that recorded value being authentic; it provides no protection if the expected issuer was obtained from an unvalidated source.

MCP authorization servers **SHOULD** include the `iss` parameter in authorization responses, including error responses, as defined in [RFC9207 Section 2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207#section-2). Authorization servers that include the `iss` parameter **MUST** advertise this by setting `authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported` to `true` in their metadata ([RFC9207 Section 2.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207#section-2.3)).

On receiving the authorization response, MCP clients **MUST** apply the validation in [RFC9207 Section 2.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207#section-2.4) before transmitting the authorization code to any token endpoint:

| `authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported` | `iss` in response | Client action |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------- |
| `true` | present | Compare to the recorded issuer using simple string comparison ([RFC3986 Section 6.2.1][1]) |
| `true` | absent | Reject the response |
| `false` or absent | present | Compare to the recorded issuer using simple string comparison ([RFC3986 Section 6.2.1][1]) |
| `false` or absent | absent | Proceed |

[1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-6.2.1

The third row applies the local-policy provision in [RFC9207 Section 2.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207#section-2.4): this specification compares a present `iss` against the recorded issuer regardless of metadata advertisement, to accommodate authorization servers that emit `iss` before updating their metadata.

A future revision of this specification is expected to upgrade authorization server inclusion of `iss` from **SHOULD** to **MUST**. Implementers are encouraged to emit and validate `iss` now to ease that transition; client rejection behavior on `iss` absence will continue to be keyed on `authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported` until that revision defines the upgrade path.

After decoding the `iss` value from the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` response per [RFC 9207 Section 2.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207#section-2.4), clients **MUST NOT** apply scheme or host case folding, default-port elision, trailing-slash, or percent-encoding normalization ([RFC 3986 Sections 6.2.2-6.2.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-6.2.2)) before comparison.

This validation applies equally to error responses - on mismatch the client **MUST NOT** act on or display `error`, `error_description`, or `error_uri`.

## Resource Parameter Implementation

MCP clients **MUST** implement Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0 as defined in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)
to explicitly specify the target resource for which the token is being requested. The `resource` parameter:

1. **MUST** be included in both authorization requests and token requests.
2. **MUST** identify the MCP server that the client intends to use the token with.
3. **MUST** use the canonical URI of the MCP server as defined in [RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#name-access-token-request).

### Canonical Server URI

For the purposes of this specification, the canonical URI of an MCP server is defined as the resource identifier as specified in
[RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2) and aligns with the `resource` parameter in
[RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728).

MCP clients **SHOULD** provide the most specific URI that they can for the MCP server they intend to access, following the guidance in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707). While the canonical form uses lowercase scheme and host components, implementations **SHOULD** accept uppercase scheme and host components for robustness and interoperability.

Examples of valid canonical URIs:

* `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`
* `https://mcp.example.com`
* `https://mcp.example.com:8443`
* `https://mcp.example.com/server/mcp` (when path component is necessary to identify individual MCP server)

Examples of invalid canonical URIs:

* `mcp.example.com` (missing scheme)
* `https://mcp.example.com#fragment` (contains fragment)

> **Note:** While both `https://mcp.example.com/` (with trailing slash) and `https://mcp.example.com` (without trailing slash) are technically valid absolute URIs according to [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986), implementations **SHOULD** consistently use the form without the trailing slash for better interoperability unless the trailing slash is semantically significant for the specific resource.

For example, if accessing an MCP server at `https://mcp.example.com`, the authorization request would include:

```
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.example.com
```

MCP clients **MUST** send this parameter regardless of whether authorization servers support it.

## Access Token Usage

### Token Requirements

Access token handling when making requests to MCP servers **MUST** conform to the requirements defined in
[OAuth 2.1 Section 5 "Resource Requests"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5).
Specifically:

1. MCP client **MUST** use the Authorization request header field defined in
   [OAuth 2.1 Section 5.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.1.1):

```
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

Note that authorization **MUST** be included in every HTTP request from client to server.

2. Access tokens **MUST NOT** be included in the URI query string

Example request:

```http
GET /mcp HTTP/1.1
Host: mcp.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

### Token Handling

MCP servers, acting in their role as an OAuth 2.1 resource server, **MUST** validate access tokens as described in
[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.2).
MCP servers **MUST** validate that access tokens were issued specifically for them as the intended audience,
according to [RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2).
If validation fails, servers **MUST** respond according to
[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.3)
error handling requirements. Invalid or expired tokens **MUST** receive a HTTP 401
response.

MCP clients **MUST NOT** send tokens to the MCP server other than ones issued by the MCP server's authorization server.

MCP servers **MUST** only accept tokens that are valid for use with their
own resources.

MCP servers **MUST NOT** accept or transit any other tokens.

## Refresh Tokens

This section provides guidance for MCP Clients and MCP Servers when handling or issuing
refresh tokens for both OAuth and OpenID Connect.

**MCP Clients** that desire refresh tokens:

* **MUST** keep refresh tokens confidential in transit and storage as specified in [OAuth 2.1 Section 4.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-14#section-4.3)
* **SHOULD** include `refresh_token` in their `grant_types` client metadata
* **MAY** add `offline_access` to the `scope` parameter of the authorization and token requests when the Authorization Server metadata contains it in `scopes_supported`
* **MUST NOT** assume refresh tokens will be issued; the AS retains discretion

**MCP Servers** (Protected Resources) **SHOULD NOT** include `offline_access` in
`WWW-Authenticate` scope or Protected Resource Metadata `scopes_supported`, as refresh
tokens are not a resource requirement.

## Error Handling

Servers **MUST** return appropriate HTTP status codes for authorization errors:

| Status Code | Description  | Usage                                      |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 401         | Unauthorized | Authorization required or token invalid    |
| 403         | Forbidden    | Invalid scopes or insufficient permissions |
| 400         | Bad Request  | Malformed authorization request            |

### Scope Challenge Handling

This section covers handling insufficient scope errors during runtime operations when
a client already has a token but needs additional permissions. This follows the error
handling patterns defined in [OAuth 2.1 Section 5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5)
and leverages the metadata fields from [RFC 9728 (OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728).

#### Runtime Insufficient Scope Errors

When a client makes a request with an access token with insufficient
scope during runtime operations, the server **SHOULD** respond with:

* `HTTP 403 Forbidden` status code (per [RFC 6750 Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3.1))
* `WWW-Authenticate` header with the `Bearer` scheme and additional parameters:
  * `error="insufficient_scope"` - indicating the specific type of authorization failure
  * `scope="required_scope1 required_scope2"` - specifying the minimum scopes needed for the operation
  * `resource_metadata` - the URI of the Protected Resource Metadata document (for consistency with 401 responses)
  * `error_description` (optional) - human-readable description of the error

**Server Scope Management**: When responding with insufficient scope errors, servers
**SHOULD** include the scopes needed to satisfy the current operation in the `scope`
parameter, consistent with
[RFC 6750 Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3.1).
The `scope` attribute describes the scopes necessary to access
the requested resource -- servers are not required to include
the client's previously granted scopes.

Servers have flexibility in determining which scopes to include:

* **Minimum approach**: Include only the scopes required for the
  specific operation that triggered the error.
* **Recommended approach**: Include the scopes required for the
  current operation along with related scopes that commonly work
  together, to reduce the number of step-up authorization rounds.
* **Extended approach**: Include the scopes required for the
  current operation, related scopes, and any other scopes the
  server anticipates the client may need in the near future.

The choice depends on the server's assessment of user experience impact and authorization friction.

Regardless of the approach chosen, servers **SHOULD** include all
scopes required for the current operation in a single challenge.
Challenging incrementally (returning one missing scope, then another
on the subsequent retry) forces multiple authorization round-trips
for a single operation and degrades user experience. The required
scopes may be determined dynamically based on the specific request
arguments and context, but once determined, they should be emitted
together.

Servers **SHOULD** be consistent in their scope inclusion strategy to provide predictable behavior for clients.

Servers **SHOULD** consider the user experience impact when determining which scopes to include in the
response, as misconfigured scopes may require frequent user interaction.

> **Note:** Scope accumulation across operations is a client-side responsibility. Clients
> **SHOULD** compute the union of previously requested scopes and newly
> challenged scopes when initiating re-authorization, as described in [Step-Up
> Authorization Flow](#step-up-authorization-flow). This allows servers to
> remain stateless with respect to client scope sets while ensuring clients do
> not lose previously granted permissions.

Example insufficient scope response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope",
                         scope="files:write",
                         resource_metadata="https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource",
                         error_description="File write permission required for this operation"
```

#### Step-Up Authorization Flow

Clients will receive scope-related errors during initial authorization or at runtime (`insufficient_scope`).
Clients **SHOULD** respond to these errors by requesting a new access token with an increased set of scopes via a step-up authorization flow or handle the errors in other, appropriate ways.
Clients acting on behalf of a user **SHOULD** attempt the step-up authorization flow. Clients acting on their own behalf (`client_credentials` clients)
**MAY** attempt the step-up authorization flow or abort the request immediately.

The flow is as follows:

1. **Parse error information** from the authorization server response or `WWW-Authenticate` header
2. **Determine required scopes** by computing the union of the
   client's previously requested scope set and the scopes from
   the current challenge. This ensures previously granted
   permissions are preserved when servers emit per-operation
   scope challenges per
   [RFC 6750 Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3.1).
   Clients **MAY** also consult the
   [Scope Selection Strategy](#scope-selection-strategy) for
   initial scope selection guidance.
3. **Initiate (re-)authorization** with the determined scope set
4. **Retry the original request** with the new authorization no more than a few times and treat this as a permanent authorization failure

Clients **SHOULD** implement retry limits and **SHOULD** track scope upgrade attempts to avoid
repeated failures for the same resource and operation combination.

> **Note on hierarchical scopes**: Some authorization servers define scope hierarchies
> where a broader scope implies narrower ones (for example, an `admin` scope
> that subsumes `read`). When accumulating scopes, the client's union may
> contain semantically redundant entries -- for example, a token previously
> granted a broad scope may be challenged with a narrower one it already
> implies. Clients need not deduplicate hierarchically; authorization servers
> typically normalize such redundancy during token issuance. Servers, for their
> part, must account for hierarchy when deciding whether a token is sufficient
> for an operation, but this does not affect the scopes they emit in a
> challenge.

## Security Considerations

Implementations of this specification **MUST** follow the normative security
requirements in [Security Considerations](./basic-authorization-security-considerations.md),
covering token audience binding and validation, token theft, communication security,
authorization code protection, mix-up and confused deputy attacks, open redirection,
and Client ID Metadata Document security.

## MCP Authorization Extensions

There are several authorization extensions to the core protocol that define additional authorization mechanisms. These extensions are:

* **Optional** - Implementations can choose to adopt these extensions
* **Additive** - Extensions do not modify or break core protocol functionality; they add new capabilities while preserving core protocol behavior
* **Composable** - Extensions are modular and designed to work together without conflicts, allowing implementations to adopt multiple extensions simultaneously
* **Versioned independently** - Extensions follow the core MCP versioning cycle but may adopt independent versioning as needed

A list of supported extensions can be found in the [MCP Authorization Extensions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-auth) repository.
