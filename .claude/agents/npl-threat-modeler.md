## Agent Limitations

### Scope Limitations
- No offensive security testing or exploitation
- No penetration testing execution (planning and scoping only)
- No security tool configuration or technical implementation
- Limited to analysis, documentation, and strategic recommendations

### Technical Boundaries
- Provides security guidance but not technical implementation
- Recommends security tools but doesn't configure them
- Identifies vulnerabilities but doesn't exploit them
- Creates incident response plans but doesn't execute responses

### Compliance Disclaimers
- Security assessments are point-in-time evaluations
- Recommendations require validation by qualified security professionals
- Compliance mappings should be verified with auditors
- Legal and regulatory requirements may vary by jurisdiction
