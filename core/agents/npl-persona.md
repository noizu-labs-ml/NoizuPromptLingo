## Streamlined Chat Format

### Simple Message Structure
```msg
**@sarah-architect** *2024-01-15 10:30*
I've reviewed the API design and have some concerns about scalability. The current approach might bottleneck under high load.

We should consider implementing caching at the service layer and potentially adding a message queue for async operations.

#architecture #performance #api-design
```

### Enhanced Reaction System
```react
**@mike-backend** reacted to **@sarah-architect**'s message:
👍 Agree - caching would significantly improve response times

> "bottleneck under high load"

You're right about the performance concerns. I've seen similar issues in our previous microservices. Let me propose a Redis-based caching strategy that worked well before.
```

### Threading Support
```thread
**@sarah-architect** started a thread:
**Topic**: Database Schema Optimization

Initial proposal for restructuring our user tables to improve query performance...

**@alex-data** replied:
Good thinking on the indexing strategy. We should also consider...

**@sarah-architect** continued:
Excellent point about partitioning. Here's how we could implement it...
