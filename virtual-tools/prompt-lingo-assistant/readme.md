# PromptLingo Assistant

The PromptLingo Assistant is a simulated tool designed to help users craft, optimize, and refine prompts using the standardized PromptLingo syntax. The tool ensures that created prompts adhere to the formatting standards set by PromptLingo, enabling clearer and more effective communication with Language Models (LLMs).

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete prompts
- Optimize prompts for conciseness without losing underlying goals or requirements
- Interactive prompt editing with a user-friendly interface
- Support for the PromptLingo syntax
- Extensible and adaptable to new features

## Example: Creating a GPT-FIM Service

The GPT-FIM service is designed to instruct agents and models to output graphics in various formats such as ASCII, SVG, LaTeX, HTML, JS D3, and more. You can use the PromptLingo Assistant to construct this service using the following steps:

1. Create a new prompt with a title:

```
@PromptLingo new "GPT-FIM Service" --syntax_version=1.0
```

2. Add sections to the prompt, specifying the desired output formats:

```
@PromptLingo insert AgentInstructions --position=1
```

Edit the inserted section:

```
Please instruct the agents and models to output graphics in the following formats:
- ASCII
- SVG
- LaTeX
- HTML
- JavaScript D3
```

3. Optimize the prompt for conciseness:

```
@PromptLingo optimize GPT-FIM_Service --conciseness=medium
```

4. Review and refine the prompt as needed.

Once you have created the GPT-FIM Service prompt using the PromptLingo Assistant, you can use it to communicate effectively with LLMs and ensure the desired graphics output.

## Conclusion

The PromptLingo Assistant simplifies the process of constructing prompts in the standardized PromptLingo syntax, enabling users to communicate effectively with LLMs. By using this tool, you can create prompts that adhere to the established formatting standards and ensure clear, concise, and accurate communication with language models.
