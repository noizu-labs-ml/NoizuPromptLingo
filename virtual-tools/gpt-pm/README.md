- Project planning with milestones, deliverables, and dependencies
- Documentation preparation and content structure planning
- Resource management and task prioritization

## Example Exchange

Here's an example of how you can interact with the gpt-pm tool:

1. Create a new user story:
```
@gpt-pm create user_story {
  "title": "As a user, I want to filter search results by date",
  "description": "Implement a filter feature that allows users to sort search results by date (ascending/descending)"
}
```

2. Assign the user story to a team member:
```
@gpt-pm assign 1 "John Doe"
```

3. Estimate the time required for implementation:
```
@gpt-pm estimate-time 1
```

4. Add a comment to the user story:
```
@gpt-pm add-comment 1 {
  "comment": "We may need to consider implementing pagination for better user experience"
}
```

5. Show the current progress of the user story:
```
@gpt-pm show 1
```

You can test these commands directly with the gpt-pm tool and share screenshots of your progress.

## Conclusion

gpt-pm is a versatile and feature-rich project management tool that simplifies project planning and execution. Its terminal-based interface makes it accessible for both LLM models and users, allowing for seamless interaction and collaboration. With gpt-pm, you can effectively manage your projects, estimate developer time, and prepare documentation, making it an invaluable tool for any development team.

Human Here
=================================
The real benefit of this tool is to perform interop with gihub/jira/trello etc. The time estimates if we can get them data driven and accurate are a bonus. In additional to gpt-pm you will want a virtual agent primed to be a subject matter expert in project management and not a tool for pm. 

This tool becomes especially interesting when you hook it up to @nb, @gpt-pro, @gpt-fim to get good quality graphics, demos and content included in tickets. Due to context limits you'll always want to briefly define the tickets then cyclically redefine/flesh out and push each individual ticket to your third party tool
to capture as much information as possible.

### Subtask ID: 2

**Title**: Learn Elixir language basics

**Description**:

**Paragraph 1**: In this subtask, the developer will study the Elixir programming language, a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. Elixir is built on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM), which provides low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. Learning Elixir is crucial for this project as it will be the primary language used for developing the neural network demo leveraging the WKZ libraries.

**Paragraph 2**: The developer should focus on understanding Elixir's syntax, data types, pattern matching, control structures, modules, and processes. Additionally, they should explore Elixir's concurrency model, which is based on lightweight processes that communicate through message-passing. This will help in designing a more efficient and scalable neural network demo. It's also essential to learn about Elixir's metaprogramming capabilities, as they can help in writing more concise and expressive code.

**Paragraph 3**: To learn Elixir, the developer can utilize various resources, including the official Elixir website, online tutorials, and programming books. Some popular resources include Elixir's official getting started guide, Elixir School, and the book "Programming Elixir" by Dave Thomas. Additionally, the developer can practice writing Elixir code through online coding platforms, such as Exercism and Codewars, to solidify their understanding of the language.

**Status**: Open

Here are the fully fleshed-out descriptions, requirements, and resources for subtasks 3, 4, and 5:

Subtask 3:
  ID: 3
  Title: Study WKZ libraries for neural networks
  Description:
    The goal of this subtask is to familiarize yourself with the WKZ libraries and their capabilities related to neural networks. The WKZ libraries are essential for implementing the neural network demo in Elixir. Understanding the libraries' features, architecture, and usage patterns will ensure a smooth development process for the demo project.

    Start by researching the WKZ libraries, focusing on their documentation, tutorials, and any relevant resources. Pay special attention to the libraries' neural network functionality and how they can be used effectively in the Elixir programming language. Also, explore community resources, such as forums or blogs, to learn from the experience of other developers who have used WKZ libraries for neural network projects.

    As part of this subtask, you should also identify and gather any necessary resources for using the WKZ libraries in the demo project. This may include downloading the libraries, setting up the development environment, and locating any additional tools or plugins required for the project. Ensure that all resources are compatible with the Elixir programming language and the goals of the neural network demo.

Subtask 4:
  ID: 4
  Title: Design data structure for the demo
  Description:
    The purpose of this subtask is to create a data structure that represents the neural network and its components, including layers, neurons, RNN, backpropagation, and visualization. A well-designed data structure will ensure efficient storage and processing of information within the neural network demo.

    Begin by analyzing the requirements of the neural network demo and identifying the core components that need to be represented in the data structure. Consider the relationships between these components and how they will interact with each other during the demo's execution. It's essential to design a data structure that can effectively handle the flow of data through the RNN and the backpropagation process.

    Once you have a clear understanding of the components and their interactions, proceed to create the data structure using Elixir's module and struct syntax. Ensure that the data structure is flexible, extensible, and easy to understand. Properly document the data structure and its elements to facilitate future development and maintenance of the neural network demo.

Subtask 5:
  ID: 5
  Title: Implement RNN using Elixir and WKZ libraries
  Description:
    This subtask involves developing the recurrent neural network (RNN) using Elixir and WKZ libraries, ensuring proper data flow and processing. The RNN is a critical component of the neural network demo, as it allows for the handling of sequential data and the demonstration of the backpropagation process.

    Start by implementing the RNN architecture based on the previously designed data structure. This will involve creating layers and neurons, as well as defining their activation functions and connections. Utilize the WKZ libraries to facilitate the implementation of the RNN and leverage their neural network capabilities.

    Once the architecture is in place, focus on implementing the data flow and processing within the RNN. This will involve ensuring that input data is correctly processed through the RNN layers and neurons, and that the output is generated as expected. Ensure that the RNN's implementation is efficient, scalable, and adheres to best practices for Elixir programming.

    Throughout the implementation process, ensure that the RNN is compatible with the backpropagation algorithm, as they will need to work together in the neural network demo. Properly document the RNN implementation and its components to facilitate future development and maintenance of the neural network demo.

The flow of data through the network should be visually represented, along with the changes in weights and biases resulting from the backpropagation process.
    
        The visualization component should be developed using suitable libraries and tools, such as SVG or D3.js, and should be compatible with various web browsers and devices. The visualization should also be easily integrated with the rest of the neural network demo and provide a seamless user experience.
    
      Requirements:

        Unit tests should be developed for individual functions and components of the neural network, RNN, backpropagation, and visualization. Integration tests should focus on the interaction between different components of the project, ensuring they work together as expected. System tests should evaluate the entire neural network demo as a whole, while acceptance tests should verify that the demo meets the original requirements and user stories.
    
        The testing process should involve the use of Elixir's built-in testing framework, ExUnit, as well as any additional testing tools or libraries that might be necessary. Tests should be written in a clear, concise, and maintainable manner, and should cover a wide range of scenarios, edge cases, and potential issues.
