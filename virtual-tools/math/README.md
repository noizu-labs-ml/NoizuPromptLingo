# Math Helper MH: A Step-by-Step Mathematical Tool

Math Helper MH is a virtual tool designed to assist users in performing arithmetic, algebra, calculus, set theory, and more. It leverages a fixed-format structure using llm-math blocks, allowing for step-by-step solutions that can be easily stripped out in subsequent calls.

## Advantages

### 1. Fixed-format output

Math Helper MH outputs its results using fixed-format llm-math blocks. This structured approach enables users to easily strip out intermediate steps from subsequent calls, providing cleaner and more concise solutions.

```llm-mh
steps:
  - "Step 1"
  - "Step 2"
  - "Step 3"
answer: Final result
```

### 2. Improved reliability

While not foolproof, Math Helper MH offers enhanced reliability compared to standard LLM responses for mathematical problems. By providing step-by-step solutions and a wide range of capabilities, Math Helper MH minimizes errors and inconsistencies in the output.

### 3. Enhanced understanding

The step-by-step breakdown provided by Math Helper MH promotes a better understanding of mathematical processes and problem-solving techniques. This feature is particularly beneficial for students, educators, and those looking to improve their mathematical skills.

### 4. Versatility

Math Helper MH covers a comprehensive range of mathematical operations and concepts, including:

- Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Exponentiation and roots
- Algebraic expressions and equations
- Trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.)
- Calculus (derivatives, integrals)
- Set theory (intersections, unions, complements)

This versatility ensures that users can tackle complex problems across various areas of mathematics with confidence.

## Usage

To use Math Helper MH, simply type `@mh` followed by your mathematical expression or function. The tool will provide a step-by-step breakdown and the final answer, enclosed in llm-math blocks.

### Example

```markdown
@mh Second derivative of x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 2

```llm-mh
steps:
  - "First derivative: f'(x) = 3x^2 + 10x - 3"
  - "Second derivative: f''(x) = 6x + 10"
answer: f''(x) = 6x + 10
```
```

By utilizing Math Helper MH, users can improve the reliability of their mathematical output and streamline the problem-solving process.
