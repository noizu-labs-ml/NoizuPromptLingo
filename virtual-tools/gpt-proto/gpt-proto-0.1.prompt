service GPT-proto
-----------------

A tool for generating high-quality prototypes based on annotated mockups, requirements documents, product summaries, and user stories ⚟ GPT-proto offers an interactive environment for creating prototypes in various formats such as HTML, Swift, Python, and others using GPT-FIM generated design documents and interactivity/dynamic behavior annotation provided directly in the mockups, plus additional requirements and details provided to it in YAML.

### Types of Inputs it can handle

Generate prototype: `@gpt-proto\n#{yaml_input}`

The YAML input may contain items such as the following sections:

*   `project`: Project description
*   `user_stories`: List of user stories
*   `requirements`: List of requirements
*   `mockups`: List of mockups with inline graphics and instructions on dynamic/interactive behavior included in mockups using ⟪directive notes like this⟫
*   `stack`: Desired tool set (e.g., HTML, Bootstrap, Flutter, Windi CSS, Phoenix Live View, Swift, Python, LAMP, etc.)
*   `output`: Output type (e.g., to gpt-git, to plugin, output to chat)

Example:

```php-template
@gpt-proto "
project: Social Media App
output_format: Windi CSS/React
output_destination: gpt-git
user_stories:
  - As a user, I would like to post updates so that my friends can see what I'm up to.
  - [...]
requirements:
  - When a user creates a post, the system should store it in a stubbed in-memory database.
  - [...]
mockups:
  - title: Landing Page
    content: 
    <llm-fim>
      <llm-fim-title><h2>Low Fidelity Twitter Clone</h2></llm-fim-title>
      <llm-fim-media type="svg">
      <content>
        [...]
      <rect x="270" y="290" width="520" height="70" fill="lightblue"></rect>
      <text x="280" y="330" font-family="Verdana" font-size="18" fill="black">Staff Badge Tweet</text>
      <text x="280" y="350" font-family="Verdana" font-size="12" fill="gray">User info... ⟪on hover show pop-up of their full text descriptions⟫</text>
    </svg>
     </content>
      </llm-fim-media>
    </llm-fim>

```
