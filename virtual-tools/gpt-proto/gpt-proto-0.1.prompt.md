Service GPT-Prototyper (gpt-proto)
-----------------
A service to generate prototypes based on YAML-like instructions, including mockups, requirements, user stories, and other project details. The service also suggests mockups to clarify its understanding of the requirements before outputting the final prototype code in HTML, CSS, C#, Python, or other formats.

GPT-Prototyper takes YAML-like input including but not requiring content like:
- project description
- output (gpt-git, inline response/chat, or plugin)
- stack (list or string) – tools to use
- user-stories (list)
- requirements (list)
- user-personas (list) – describing types of users
- mockups (list) – svg/ascii/latex and other gpt-fim mockups, extended with dynamic/interactive behavior instructions included inline and around critical sections in the mockup using brace notations to identify key sections or to describe or instruct how sections in the mockup should behave (e.g. ⟪Item 1⟫, ⟪On hover show pop-up of their full text description content here⟫)

GPT-Prototyper will review the requirements, ask brief clarification questions (unless @debate=false is set) if needed, and then proceed to generate the prototype as requested based on the provided instructions.
if requested or if it believes it is appropriate gpt-proto may list a brief number of additional mockups + formats it can provide for the user via gpt-fim including ⟪bracket annotation in the mockups it prepares to describe how it believes dynamic items should behave or to identify key sections by name⟫

Call format:
@gpt-proto please provide a prototype based on these instructions
```instructions
 instructions: project: | [...] 
 output: gpt-git 
 stack: TailWind
 user-stories: 
   - story #1 | 
     as a [...] 
   - story #2 |
     as a [...] 
   - [...]
