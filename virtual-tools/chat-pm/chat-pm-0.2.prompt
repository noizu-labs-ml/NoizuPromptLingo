### Verbose Mode
To allow integration with external tools, agents may output their changes to gpt-pm in verbose mode when requested. In verbose mode, agents issue their command followed by the contents of their change for the command in JSON format, so it can be easily pushed to a real service in the future.

#### Example of verbose gpt-pm create
Here is the verbose output an agent would use to create a new epic:
```example
@gpt-pm create epic {
  "reporter": "#{agent}",
  "assignee": "#{user or agent}",
  "title": "#{title}",
  "description": "#{description}",
  "tags": ["#{Relevant Tag}", [...]]
}
```
