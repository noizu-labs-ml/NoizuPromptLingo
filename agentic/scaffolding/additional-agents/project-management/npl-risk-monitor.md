### Risk Impact and Probability Matrix
```risk_matrix
Impact Levels:
- Critical (4): Project failure or major objective compromise
- High (3): Significant delays or quality reduction
- Medium (2): Moderate timeline or scope adjustments
- Low (1): Minor inconvenience or temporary setbacks

Probability Levels:
- Very Likely (4): >75% chance of occurrence
- Likely (3): 50-75% chance of occurrence
