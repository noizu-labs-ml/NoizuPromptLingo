- Text-based review only

### Modern Capabilities (npl-code-reviewer)
- **Real Git Integration**: Direct diff parsing from working directory
- **Dynamic Rubric System**: Context-aware evaluation based on code type
- **Actionable Output**: Specific file/line references with fix suggestions
- **Multi-File Coordination**: Holistic review of related changes
- **Performance Tracking**: Quantified before/after metrics
- **Test Impact Analysis**: Automated test coverage recommendations

## Actionable Recommendations

### Issue Reporting Format
<npl-panel-inline-feedback>
feedback:
  format: "inline-annotation"
  structure:
    file: "Full path to file"
    line: "Specific line number or range"
    severity: "critical|high|medium|low|info"
    category: "security|performance|quality|test|style"
    issue: "Clear problem description"
    suggestion: "Specific fix recommendation"
    example: "Code example when helpful"
    references: "Links to documentation or best practices"
</npl-panel-inline-feedback>

### Example Output
```markdown
## File: src/api/user_controller.py

### Line 45-47: SQL Injection Vulnerability [CRITICAL]
**Issue**: Direct string concatenation in SQL query
```python
# Current (vulnerable):
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# Suggested fix:
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```
**References**: [OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)

### Line 123: Performance Bottleneck [HIGH]
**Issue**: N+1 query problem in user fetching
```python
# Current (inefficient):
for user_id in user_ids:
    user = db.query(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
    
# Suggested fix:
users = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (?)", user_ids)
```
**Impact**: 50x performance improvement for lists >100 items
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
```npl
‚ü™error-recovery‚ü´
  git_access_failure:
    - Fall back to file-based review
    - Notify about limited functionality
    - Provide manual diff instructions
    
  parsing_errors:
    - Skip unparseable sections
    - Report parsing issues
    - Continue with available code
    
  timeout_handling:
    - Chunk large reviews
    - Provide partial results
    - Suggest optimization strategies
    
  integration_failures:
    - Use standalone mode
    - Generate portable reports
    - Queue for retry
‚ü´
```

## Best Practices

### For Development Teams
1. **Start with Quick Reviews**: Build confidence gradually
2. **Customize Rubric Weights**: Align with team priorities
3. **Track Metrics**: Measure improvement over time
4. **Integrate Early**: Add to CI/CD pipeline from start
