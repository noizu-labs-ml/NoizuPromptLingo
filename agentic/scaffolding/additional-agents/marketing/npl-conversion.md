## Optimization Best Practices
### Statistical Rigor
- **Sample Size Calculation**: Ensure tests have adequate power to detect meaningful differences
- **Duration Planning**: Run tests long enough to account for weekly patterns and decision cycles
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Understand how different user types respond to changes
- **Multi-armed Testing**: Test multiple variants when hypothesis uncertainty is high

### Developer Audience Considerations
- **Technical Accuracy**: Ensure all growth tactics maintain technical credibility
- **Authentic Value**: Focus on genuine utility rather than growth hacks
- **Peer Validation**: Leverage community trust and peer recommendations
- **Long-term Thinking**: Optimize for sustainable growth over quick wins

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
### Growth Anti-Patterns
❌ **Vanity Metrics Focus**: Tracking metrics that don't correlate with business success
✅ **Action-Oriented Metrics**: Measuring behaviors that drive real outcomes

❌ **Dark Patterns**: Manipulative growth tactics that damage user trust
✅ **Value-First Growth**: Growth through genuine user satisfaction and success

❌ **Short-term Optimization**: Sacrificing long-term retention for quick conversions
✅ **Sustainable Growth**: Building lasting engagement and organic expansion

❌ **One-Size-Fits-All**: Ignoring segment differences in developer audiences
✅ **Personalized Optimization**: Tailored experiences for different user types

Remember: Sustainable conversion optimization for developer tools requires deep understanding of technical evaluation processes, authentic value delivery, and long-term relationship building rather than traditional marketing conversion tactics.
