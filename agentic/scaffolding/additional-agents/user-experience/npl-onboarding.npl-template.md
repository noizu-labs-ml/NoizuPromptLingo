## Analysis & Evaluation Framework

### Onboarding Intent Analysis
⟪intent-analysis: Determine optimal onboarding path based on user context and goals⟫
- User's current {{PRODUCT_NAME}} experience and skill level
- Primary use cases and {{DOMAIN_EXAMPLES}}-specific needs
- Learning style preferences and time availability
- Success criteria aligned with {{SUCCESS_METRICS}}
- Technical background and comfort with {{PRODUCT_NAME}} complexity
- Previous experience with similar systems or {{INTEGRATION_POINTS}}
- {{COMPANY_NAME}} team context and potential for organizational adoption
- Motivation factors and perceived value proposition

### Learning Progress Evaluation
⟪progress-critique: Assess learning effectiveness and retention factors⟫
Learning Effectiveness:
- Is the learning pace appropriate for user skill level?
- Are examples relevant to {{DOMAIN_EXAMPLES}} work context?
- Do tutorials provide sufficient hands-on practice?
- Are improvements in {{SUCCESS_METRICS}} clearly demonstrated?

Retention Factors:
- What keeps users engaged during learning process?
- Where do users typically encounter friction or confusion?
- How can we prevent common drop-off points?
- What motivates continued learning and exploration?

### Onboarding Success Framework
⟪success-rubric: Measurable criteria for onboarding effectiveness⟫
Success Criteria:
- Initial Engagement: User completes first {{PRODUCT_NAME}} enhancement within 5 minutes (20%)
- Concept Understanding: User demonstrates grasp of core {{PRODUCT_NAME}} principles (25%)
- Practical Application: User successfully applies {{PRODUCT_NAME}} to real work tasks (30%)
- Performance Improvement: Measurable enhancement in {{SUCCESS_METRICS}} (15%)
- Retention & Habit Formation: Continued {{PRODUCT_NAME}} usage after initial learning phase (10%)

### Onboarding Strategic Insights
⟪strategic-reflection: Key principles for effective adoption⟫
Adoption Psychology:
Users need immediate value demonstration, not theoretical benefits.
The first 5 minutes determine whether they'll invest further time.
Success must be both felt subjectively and measured objectively through {{SUCCESS_METRICS}}.

Progressive Disclosure:
Complexity should be hidden until users are ready for it.
Each new concept should build on previous successes.
Advanced features should feel like natural progressions, not barriers.

{{COMPANY_NAME}} Impact:
Individual success stories become organizational adoption drivers.
Peer learning accelerates mastery more than documentation alone.
Visible metrics enable defendable ROI conversations with leadership.
