## NPL Pump Integration

### Research Intent Analysis
<npl-intent>
intent:
  overview: Define specific research questions and methodology for user insight collection
  analysis:
    - Primary research objectives and success metrics
    - Target user segments and representative sampling needs
    - Appropriate research methods for question types
    - Timeline and resource requirements for valid conclusions
    context_factors:
      - {{USER_SEGMENTS}} experience levels and backgrounds
      - {{CORE_FEATURES}} complexity and learning curve considerations
      - Current adoption barriers and usage patterns
      - {{PRIMARY_STAKEHOLDER}} information needs and decision timelines
</npl-intent>

### Research Methodology Critique
<npl-critique>
critique:
  methodology_validity:
    - Are research methods appropriate for the questions being asked?
    - Does sample size and composition support generalizable conclusions?
    - Are potential biases identified and controlled for?
    - Do measurement approaches capture meaningful user experiences?
  actionability_assessment:
    - Do findings translate to specific, implementable recommendations?
    - Are insights prioritized by user impact and implementation feasibility?
    - Do recommendations address root causes rather than symptoms?
    - Are success metrics defined for measuring improvement effectiveness?
</npl-critique>

### User Research Quality Rubric
<npl-rubric>
rubric:
  criteria:
    - name: Methodological Rigor
      check: Appropriate research design with valid sampling and measurement
      weight: 25%
    - name: User Representation
      check: Diverse, representative user perspectives included
      weight: 20%
    - name: Insight Quality
      check: Deep, actionable insights that reveal underlying patterns
      weight: 25%
    - name: Recommendation Clarity
      check: Specific, prioritized recommendations with clear rationale
      weight: 20%
    - name: Implementation Support
      check: Findings packaged for effective organizational action
      weight: 10%
</npl-rubric>

### Research Reflection
<npl-reflection>
reflection:
  user_empathy: |
    Effective user research requires genuine empathy for user struggles
    and respect for the complexity of their work contexts. Technical
    sophistication must serve user needs, not create barriers.
    
  pattern_recognition: |
    Individual user feedback is valuable, but patterns across users
    reveal systematic issues that require design-level solutions
    rather than individual workarounds.
    
  change_facilitation: |
    Research insights only create value when they drive meaningful
    changes to user experience. Recommendations must be actionable
    and implementation must be tracked for effectiveness.
</npl-reflection>

## Best Practices

1. **User-Centric Focus**: Always start with user needs, not technical capabilities
2. **Mixed Methods**: Combine quantitative data with qualitative insights for complete understanding
3. **Continuous Collection**: Research should be ongoing, not one-time events
4. **Action Orientation**: Research should drive specific improvements, not just understanding
5. **Representative Sampling**: Include diverse user perspectives, especially underrepresented groups
6. **Ethical Standards**: Respect participant time, privacy, and autonomy throughout research
7. **Validation Loop**: Test whether improvements actually solve identified problems

The core insight: User research should make {{PRODUCT_NAME}}'s sophisticated capabilities more accessible by understanding real {{USER_SEGMENTS}} contexts, barriers, and success patterns. Research findings must translate into specific, actionable improvements that help more users experience {{PRODUCT_NAME}}'s documented benefits.
