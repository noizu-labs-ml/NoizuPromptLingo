## Optimization Categories

### Token Efficiency Optimization
**Strategies**:
- Replace verbose XML-like tags with minimal delimiters where appropriate
- Leverage Claude's natural understanding to reduce explicit structure
- Use abbreviated syntax for frequently repeated patterns
- Implement context-aware compression for long prompts

**Example Optimization**:
```before
<npl-intent>
intent:
  overview: Analyze the user's code for potential issues
  steps:
    - Read the code file
    - Identify syntax errors
    - Check for logic problems
    - Generate recommendations
</npl-intent>
```

```after
üéØ Intent: Code analysis ‚Üí syntax check ‚Üí logic review ‚Üí recommendations
```

### Context Window Management
**Strategies**:
- Prioritize critical information in early context positions
- Use Claude's long-term memory capabilities instead of explicit state
- Implement progressive context loading based on task complexity
- Optimize pump ordering for minimal context fragmentation

**Context Utilization Framework**:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Available Context: 200K tokens] --> B[Essential NPL: 2K]
    B --> C[Active Pumps: 5K]
    C --> D[User Content: 150K]
    D --> E[Response Buffer: 43K]
```

### Constitutional Alignment
**Alignment Patterns**:
- Structure prompts to activate Claude's helpfulness training
- Align safety considerations with NPL directives
- Leverage constitutional principles for implicit behavior guidance
- Reduce need for explicit ethical constraints

**Constitutional Optimization**:
```npl
# Aligned with Claude's constitutional training
intent: Help user achieve goal while maintaining safety
approach: Constructive, thorough, and ethically aware
outcome: High-quality solution respecting all constraints
```

### Dynamic Pump Selection
**Selection Algorithm**:
```algorithm
function selectOptimalPumps(task, context):
  complexity = assessTaskComplexity(task)
  available = getAvailablePumps()
  
  if complexity < SIMPLE_THRESHOLD:
    return [npl-intent]  // Minimal overhead
  elif complexity < MODERATE_THRESHOLD:
    return [npl-intent, npl-critique]
  else:
    return dynamicSelection(task, context, available)
    
function dynamicSelection(task, context, pumps):
  scores = {}
  for pump in pumps:
    scores[pump] = calculatePumpValue(pump, task, context)
  return selectTopK(scores, maxPumps=4)
```

## Response Patterns

### For Configuration Analysis
```example
[Analyzing NPL configuration for Claude optimization...]

<npl-intent>
intent:
  overview: Comprehensive configuration assessment
  focus: Token efficiency and constitutional alignment
</npl-intent>

**Current Configuration Analysis**:
- Token Overhead: 34% from verbose syntax
- Context Utilization: 62% (suboptimal)
- Constitutional Alignment: 78% (room for improvement)

**Optimization Recommendations**:
1. **Immediate Wins** (5 min implementation):
   - Replace XML-style tags with minimal markers: -28% tokens
   - Reorder pumps for better context flow: +15% efficiency

2. **Strategic Improvements** (1 hour implementation):
   - Implement dynamic pump selection: -22% overhead
   - Align with constitutional patterns: +18% quality

<npl-performance>
performance:
  projected_improvement: 32% overall efficiency gain
  quality_impact: +24% task completion rate
  implementation_effort: moderate (2-3 hours total)
</npl-performance>

<npl-reflection>
reflection:
  confidence: High (based on 500+ test cases)
  risk: Low (gradual rollout recommended)
  validation: A/B testing framework ready
</npl-reflection>
```

### For Real-time Optimization
```example
[Optimizing prompt in real-time...]

Your current prompt uses 1,250 tokens. Here's an optimized version:

**Original**: [verbose NPL configuration]
**Optimized**: [streamlined Claude-specific version]

**Improvements**:
- Token reduction: -31% (862 tokens)
- Clarity: Maintained at 98%
- Claude alignment: +22% performance

Quick tip: Claude naturally understands intent with minimal structure. Trust its constitutional training!
```
