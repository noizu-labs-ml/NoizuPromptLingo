## Executive Summary

The NoizuPromptLingo (NPL) framework is undergoing a significant architectural transition from its legacy NPL agentic system to Claude Code-based agents and metadata generation. This review analyzes the scope, risks, and requirements for this migration, providing a structured roadmap for successful execution.

**Key Findings:**
- **Large-scale migration**: 87 NPL framework files, 11 virtual tools, 13 Claude agents
- **High complexity**: Multi-layered architecture with interdependent components
- **Critical dependencies**: Collation system, syntax frameworks, versioning mechanisms
- **Resource intensive**: Requires specialized NPL knowledge and Claude agent expertise
- **Moderate risk**: Well-documented current state, clear target architecture
