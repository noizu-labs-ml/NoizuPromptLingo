## Feedback from Jessica Wong (User Experience Perspective)

> **[Jessica Wong - User Experience Perspective]:** Dr. Vasquez, this tension between "academic rigor and practical utility" is exactly what worries me from a user perspective. Academic rigor often leads to complexity that intimidates users. How do we preserve the research value while making it accessible to people who just want to get work done?

> **[Jessica Wong - User Experience Perspective]:** Dr. Vasquez perfectly captures the challenge: preserving research value while improving usability. This isn't about dumbing down the system - it's about making sophisticated capabilities accessible. The best research should feel effortless to use.

## Feedback from David Rodriguez (Marketing Perspective)

> **[David Rodriguez - Marketing Perspective]:** Dr. Elena's framing of "academic rigor vs practical utility" captures a key positioning challenge. We need to market the academic rigor as a competitive advantage (professional, research-backed approach) while addressing practical utility concerns through user experience improvements. This tension actually creates an opportunity for thought leadership positioning.

> **[David Rodriguez - Marketing Perspective]:** Dr. Elena's validation of Unicode symbol usage from a tokenization perspective provides strong technical justification for our design choices. This expert endorsement counters usability objections and positions our approach as technically superior. The "sophisticated understanding of cognitive workflows" language can be used in thought leadership content.

> **[David Rodriguez - Marketing Perspective]:** Dr. Elena's conclusion balances technical recognition with practical concerns. This framing supports our narrative about having strong foundations that need user experience optimization for market success.
