## Best Practices and Tips

### 1. Preparation Tips
- **Be Specific**: Provide detailed context about your idea, target market, and constraints
- **Set Expectations**: Clearly communicate budget, timeline, and scope constraints
- **Prepare for Iteration**: Be ready to provide feedback at yield points

### 2. Effective Feedback
- **Be Specific**: Instead of "this looks good", say "expand the technical complexity analysis for Epic 2"
- **Focus on Priorities**: Identify which elements are most important for your use case
- **Ask Questions**: Use yield points to clarify assumptions or request additional detail

### 3. Yield Point Management
- **Review Thoroughly**: Take time to review each batch of deliverables
- **Request Clarification**: Ask for expansion on areas that seem unclear
- **Stay Engaged**: Active participation improves final output quality

### 4. Integration Optimization
- **Plan Integration Early**: Consider how NIMPS output will integrate with your existing tools
- **Customize Templates**: Work with @npl-templater to create organization-specific formats
- **Validate Assumptions**: Use @npl-grader to ensure deliverable quality

### 5. Phase-Specific Tips

#### Discovery Phase
- Provide comprehensive background information
- Share existing research or market knowledge
- Clarify success metrics and constraints

#### Persona Phase
- Request additional personas for edge cases
- Specify organizational context for B2B projects
- Ask for relationship mapping between persona types

#### Planning Phase
- Balance epic scope with development capacity
- Prioritize user stories based on business value
- Consider technical dependencies early

#### Architecture Phase
- Specify technology preferences or constraints
- Consider scalability requirements from start
- Plan for integration with existing systems

#### Creation Phase
- Specify asset formats and requirements
- Request multiple prototype iterations
- Focus on assets that support validation

### 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Insufficient Initial Context**: Provide comprehensive problem and solution context
- **Skipping Yield Points**: Don't rush through without reviewing deliverables
- **Over-Specification**: Focus on MVP essentials rather than comprehensive features
- **Ignoring Constraints**: Clearly communicate budget, timeline, and resource constraints
