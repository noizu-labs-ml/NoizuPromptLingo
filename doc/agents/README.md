## Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Agent Workflows

Sequential workflows involve agents working one after another, with each agent building upon the previous agent's output:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Agent 1] --> B[Output 1]
    B --> C[Agent 2]
    C --> D[Output 2]
    D --> E[Agent 3]
    E --> F[Final Result]
```

#### Example: Complete Documentation Pipeline
```bash
# Step 1: Generate technical specification
@npl-technical-writer generate spec --component=user-authentication

# Step 2: Create comprehensive test cases
@gpt-qa "Generate test cases for user authentication specification"

# Step 3: Evaluate documentation quality
@npl-grader evaluate spec.md --rubric=technical-documentation-rubric.md

# Step 4: Create marketing materials from technical spec
@npl-marketing-writer "Create developer-focused landing page from authentication spec"
```

#### Example: Project Planning Workflow
```bash
# Step 1: Analyze project idea
@nimps "Create MVP plan for task management app for freelancers"

# Step 2: Create project templates based on analysis
@npl-templater "Generate project templates from NIMPS analysis"

# Step 3: Validate planning completeness
@npl-grader evaluate project-plan.md --rubric=project-planning-rubric.md
```

### Parallel Agent Coordination

Parallel workflows involve multiple agents working simultaneously on related aspects of a problem:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Input Task] --> B[Agent 1]
    A --> C[Agent 2]
    A --> D[Agent 3]
    B --> E[Result 1]
    C --> F[Result 2]
    D --> G[Result 3]
    E --> H[Synthesis]
    F --> H
    G --> H
    H --> I[Combined Output]
```

#### Example: Multi-Perspective Code Review
```bash
# Parallel review from different perspectives
parallel --line-buffer ::: \
    '@npl-persona mike-douglas "Review authentication.py for security concerns"' \
    '@npl-persona sarah-chen "Review authentication.py for user experience implications"' \
    '@npl-persona alex-rivera "Review authentication.py for operational considerations"'
```

#### Example: Comprehensive Quality Assessment
```bash
# Simultaneous quality analysis from multiple angles
{
    @npl-grader evaluate src/ --rubric=code-quality-rubric.md &
    @npl-technical-writer review src/ --mode=annotate --focus=documentation &
    @gpt-qa "Analyze test coverage gaps in src/" &
    wait
}
```

### Complex Multi-Stage Workflows

Complex workflows combine sequential and parallel patterns for sophisticated task orchestration:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Initial Analysis] --> B[Phase 1: Parallel Analysis]
    B --> C[Agent 1]
    B --> D[Agent 2]
    B --> E[Agent 3]
    C --> F[Synthesis Agent]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Phase 2: Sequential Processing]
    G --> H[Agent 4]
    H --> I[Agent 5]
    I --> J[Final Validation]
    J --> K[Complete Solution]
```

#### Example: Complete Feature Implementation
```bash
# Phase 1: Parallel analysis and planning
{
    @npl-thinker "Analyze technical requirements for payment processing feature" &
    @npl-persona product-owner "Define user requirements for payment feature" &
    @npl-persona security-expert "Identify security requirements for payment processing" &
    wait
} > requirements-analysis.md

# Phase 2: Sequential implementation
@tdd-driven-builder "Implement payment processing using analyzed requirements"

## Advanced Orchestration

### Feedback Loops and Iterative Refinement

Some workflows benefit from feedback loops where agents refine their work based on other agents' analysis:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Initial Implementation] --> B[Quality Assessment]
    B --> C{Quality Threshold Met?}
    C -->|No| D[Refinement Agent]
    D --> A
    C -->|Yes| E[Final Output]
    
    F[Feedback Agent] --> B
    G[Context Agent] --> D
```

#### Example: Iterative Documentation Improvement
```bash
# Initial implementation
@npl-technical-writer generate api-doc --source=openapi.yaml

# Quality feedback loop
while true; do
    quality_score=$(@npl-grader evaluate api-doc.md --rubric=api-doc-rubric.md --output-score-only)
    if [[ $quality_score -gt 85 ]]; then
        break
    fi
    @npl-technical-writer review api-doc.md --mode=rewrite --focus=clarity
done

# Final validation
@npl-persona developer "Validate API documentation usability"
```

### Conditional Workflows

Workflows that adapt based on analysis results or changing conditions:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Initial Analysis] --> B{Analysis Result}
    B -->|Complex| C[Multi-Agent Deep Analysis]
    B -->|Simple| D[Single Agent Implementation]
    B -->|Requires Research| E[Research Phase]
    
    C --> F[Synthesis]
    D --> F
    E --> G[Extended Analysis]
    G --> C
```

#### Example: Adaptive Problem-Solving Workflow
```bash
# Analyze problem complexity
complexity=$(@npl-thinker "Assess complexity of implementing OAuth2 integration" --output-complexity-only)

if [[ $complexity == "high" ]]; then
    # Complex implementation path
    @npl-persona security-architect "Design OAuth2 security architecture"
    @npl-persona backend-lead "Plan technical implementation approach"
    @gopher-scout "Research existing OAuth2 implementations in similar projects"
    @tdd-driven-builder "Implement OAuth2 with comprehensive testing strategy"
elif [[ $complexity == "medium" ]]; then
    # Standard implementation path
    @npl-technical-writer "Research OAuth2 best practices and create implementation guide"
    @tdd-driven-builder "Implement OAuth2 following standard patterns"
else
    # Simple implementation path
    @tool-forge "Create simple OAuth2 integration utility"
fi

# Common validation regardless of path
@npl-grader evaluate oauth2-implementation/ --rubric=security-implementation-rubric.md
```

### Dynamic Agent Selection

Workflows that select specific agents based on project context or requirements:

```bash
# Detect project type and select appropriate agents
project_type=$(@system-digest analyze --detect-project-type)

case $project_type in
    "django")
        @django-tdd-builder "Implement feature using Django patterns"
        @django-technical-writer "Create Django-specific documentation"
        ;;
    "react")
        @react-tool-forge "Create React component implementation"
        @frontend-technical-writer "Document React component usage"
        ;;
    "microservices")
        @microservices-architect "Design service integration"
        @api-technical-writer "Create microservices API documentation"
        ;;
esac
```

## Performance Optimization

### Managing Multiple Agents Efficiently

#### Resource Management
```bash
# Limit concurrent agents to prevent resource exhaustion
sem --jobs 3 --id agent_pool

# Queue agent jobs with resource constraints
sem --id agent_pool @agent1 "task 1" &
sem --id agent_pool @agent2 "task 2" &
sem --id agent_pool @agent3 "task 3" &
wait
```

#### Agent Caching and Reuse
```bash
# Cache agent initialization for repeated use
export NPL_AGENT_CACHE_DIR=".claude/agent-cache"

# Reuse specialized agent configurations
@cached-api-analyst "Analyze authentication endpoints"  # Uses cached configuration
```

#### Batch Processing
```bash
# Process multiple similar tasks in batch
files=($(find src/ -name "*.py"))
@python-analyzer "Analyze files in batch: ${files[*]}"

# Parallel batch processing with controlled concurrency
printf '%s\n' "${files[@]}" | xargs -P 3 -I {} @file-analyzer "Analyze file {}"
```

### Monitoring and Optimization

#### Performance Metrics
```bash
# Monitor agent execution time and resource usage
time @npl-thinker "Complex analysis task"
/usr/bin/time -v @resource-intensive-agent "Large dataset processing"
```

#### Workflow Optimization
```bash
# Profile workflow bottlenecks
{
    time @agent1 "task 1" &
    time @agent2 "task 2" &  
    time @agent3 "task 3" &
    wait
} 2>&1 | grep "real\|user\|sys"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Orchestration Issues

#### **Agent Dependencies Not Met**
```
Error: Agent @specialized-agent requires output from @base-agent
```
**Solution**: Ensure sequential dependencies are properly managed
```bash
# Correct dependency chain
@base-agent "generate foundation" && @specialized-agent "build on foundation"
```

#### **Resource Contention**
```
Error: Rate limit exceeded / Resource temporarily unavailable
```
**Solution**: Implement proper concurrency control
```bash
# Limit concurrent agents
sem --jobs 2 @agent1 "task" & sem --jobs 2 @agent2 "task" & wait
```

#### **Context Loss Between Agents**
```
Warning: Agent @agent2 lacks context from @agent1
```
**Solution**: Use explicit context passing or file-based communication
```bash
# Pass context explicitly
@agent1 "task" > context.md
@agent2 "task with context from context.md"
```

#### **Quality Degradation in Chains**
```
Issue: Output quality decreases through long agent chains
```
**Solution**: Implement quality gates and validation points
```bash
# Add validation checkpoints
@agent1 "task" | tee output1.md
@npl-grader validate output1.md --threshold=80 || exit 1
@agent2 "process output1.md" | tee output2.md
@npl-grader validate output2.md --threshold=80 || exit 1
```

### Debugging Workflows

#### Enable Verbose Logging
```bash
export NPL_DEBUG=true
export NPL_LOG_LEVEL=verbose

# Run workflow with detailed logging
@complex-workflow "debug this issue"
```

#### Workflow Validation
```bash
# Validate workflow before execution
@workflow-validator "check agent dependencies and resource requirements"

# Test workflow with mock agents
@mock-agent-runner "simulate workflow execution"
```

#### State Management
```bash
# Save intermediate states for debugging
mkdir -p .claude/workflow-state
@agent1 "task" | tee .claude/workflow-state/step1.md
@agent2 "process step1" | tee .claude/workflow-state/step2.md
```

### Best Practices for Orchestration

1. **Start Sequential**: Begin with sequential workflows before attempting parallel coordination
2. **Quality Gates**: Include validation checkpoints in long workflows
3. **Context Management**: Ensure agents have necessary context from previous steps
4. **Resource Awareness**: Monitor and limit concurrent agent execution
5. **Error Handling**: Plan for agent failures and recovery strategies
6. **Documentation**: Document successful workflow patterns for team use

The NPL Agent Ecosystem provides a powerful foundation for building sophisticated, automated workflows that enhance development productivity while maintaining high quality standards. Through careful orchestration of specialized agents, teams can achieve levels of automation and consistency previously difficult to attain.
