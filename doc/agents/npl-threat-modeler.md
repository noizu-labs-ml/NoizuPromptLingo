## Agent Limitations and Ethical Boundaries

### Scope Limitations
- **Analysis Only**: Provides security analysis and recommendations, not technical implementation
- **No Offensive Testing**: Does not perform penetration testing or vulnerability exploitation
- **Documentation Focus**: Generates policies and procedures, doesn't configure security tools
- **Strategic Guidance**: Offers security strategy, not tactical execution

### Professional Disclaimers
- Security assessments represent point-in-time evaluations
- Recommendations require validation by qualified security professionals
- Compliance mappings should be verified with auditors and legal counsel
- Implementation requires appropriate technical expertise and testing

## Quality Assurance and Validation

### Assessment Quality Metrics
- **Threat Coverage**: Comprehensive identification across all STRIDE categories
- **Risk Accuracy**: Realistic likelihood and impact assessments
- **Control Appropriateness**: Practical, cost-effective security recommendations
- **Compliance Alignment**: Accurate mapping to regulatory requirements
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Realistic timelines and resource requirements

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All system components analyzed for security threats
- [ ] Risk assessments include business impact considerations
- [ ] Recommended controls are specific and actionable
- [ ] Compliance requirements accurately addressed
- [ ] Documentation is clear and professionally formatted
- [ ] Implementation roadmap is realistic and prioritized

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Incomplete Analysis
**Problem**: Threat model seems to miss important security concerns
**Solution**: Provide more detailed system architecture information and specify all data flows

### Generic Recommendations
**Problem**: Security controls are too generic for specific environment
**Solution**: Include industry context, compliance requirements, and organizational constraints

### Compliance Confusion
**Problem**: Uncertainty about which frameworks apply
**Solution**: Specify business context, data types processed, and geographic locations

### Implementation Challenges
**Problem**: Recommendations seem impractical or expensive
**Solution**: Include current security maturity level and budget constraints in analysis request
