# NPL Code Reviewer Agent Documentation

## Overview

The NPL Code Reviewer Agent is an advanced code review system that evolved from the gpt-cr virtual tool, providing comprehensive analysis through real git integration, context-aware rubric evaluation, and actionable recommendations with precise file/line references. Built on the Noizu Prompt Lingo (NPL) framework, it seamlessly integrates with Claude Code's file system access and git workflows to deliver measurable quality improvements.

## Purpose and Core Value

The npl-code-reviewer agent transforms traditional code review processes through automated, intelligent analysis that goes beyond static checking. It serves as a comprehensive quality assurance tool that:

- Parses actual git diffs from working directories for real-time review
- Applies dynamic, context-aware rubric scoring based on code type
- Generates actionable recommendations with specific file/line references
- Provides quantified before/after performance metrics
- Integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines and development workflows
- Reduces review time by 60-80% while maintaining high accuracy
