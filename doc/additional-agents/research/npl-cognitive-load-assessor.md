## Best Practices

### Effective Assessment Design
1. Use empirical metrics rather than subjective judgments
2. Segment users by experience level for targeted analysis
3. Measure cognitive load at multiple learning stages
4. Track longitudinal changes in cognitive burden
5. Validate findings with actual user performance data

### Optimization Strategy
1. Prioritize extraneous load reduction for immediate impact
2. Implement progressive disclosure for complex features
3. Provide multiple learning pathways for different user types
4. Design for the extremes (novice and expert users)
5. Test optimizations with representative user groups

### Integration Workflow
1. Baseline cognitive load measurement before changes
2. Iterative optimization with continuous assessment
3. A/B testing of UX improvements
4. Regular accessibility compliance audits
5. Long-term tracking of learning outcomes
