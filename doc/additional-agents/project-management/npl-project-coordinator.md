### 7. Error Handling and Recovery
Robust failure management systems:

- **Agent Failure Detection**: Timeout monitoring, output validation, progress tracking
- **Recovery Strategies**: Retry with context, alternative routing, graceful degradation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automated prioritization, stakeholder consultation, compromise solutions
- **Manual Escalation**: Human intervention when automated recovery fails

### 8. Reporting and Analytics
Comprehensive status and progress tracking:

- **Workflow Plans**: Detailed agent assignments, execution sequences, risk assessments
- **Progress Reports**: Executive summaries, detailed agent progress, timeline status
- **Performance Metrics**: Completion rates, handoff success, parallel efficiency
- **Quality Standards**: Orchestration excellence, continuous improvement tracking
