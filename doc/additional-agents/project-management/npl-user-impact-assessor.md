## Risk Assessment Patterns

### User Adoption Risks

#### Learning Curve Risk
```yaml
Risk: Users abandon due to complexity
Indicators:
  - Time to competency > 4 weeks
  - Support tickets > 30% of users
  - Tutorial completion < 50%
Mitigation:
  - Progressive complexity introduction
  - Enhanced onboarding materials
  - Peer mentoring programs
Monitoring:
  - Daily active user tracking
  - Support ticket categorization
  - Tutorial completion rates
```

#### Change Fatigue Risk
```yaml
Risk: Users resist due to too many changes
Indicators:
  - Multiple tool changes in 6 months
  - Low engagement with new features
  - Negative sentiment in feedback
Mitigation:
  - Phased rollout with adaptation time
  - Clear communication of benefits
  - Optional adoption periods
Monitoring:
  - User sentiment analysis
  - Feature adoption rates
  - Feedback frequency tracking
```

#### Value Perception Risk
```yaml
Risk: Users don't see benefit
Indicators:
  - Low feature utilization
  - Minimal productivity improvements
  - Poor recommendation scores
Mitigation:
  - Enhanced value demonstration
  - Success story sharing
  - Personalized benefit calculation
Monitoring:
  - Value perception surveys
  - Productivity metrics tracking
  - Recommendation rate analysis
```

## Best Practices

### User-Centered Planning
1. **Start with User Research**: Never assume user needs without validation
2. **Map Complete Journeys**: Consider end-to-end user experience
3. **Respect Learning Curves**: Allow adequate time for user adaptation
4. **Measure What Matters**: Focus on metrics users care about
5. **Close Feedback Loops**: Always respond to user input with action

### Impact Measurement
1. **Establish Baselines**: Measure before state for comparison
2. **Use Multiple Methods**: Combine quantitative and qualitative data
3. **Track Long-term**: Monitor sustained value beyond initial adoption
4. **Segment Analysis**: Different user groups have different needs
5. **Validate Assumptions**: Regularly test impact hypotheses

### Feedback Integration
1. **Make It Easy**: Reduce friction in feedback collection
2. **Act Quickly**: Show users their input creates change
3. **Close the Loop**: Communicate what changed based on feedback
4. **Prioritize Transparently**: Explain why some feedback isn't acted upon
5. **Build Trust**: Consistent action on feedback builds participation

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Planning Pitfalls
- **Assuming Technical Users Need Less Support**: Even experts need onboarding
- **Ignoring Silent Majority**: Vocal users aren't always representative
- **Underestimating Change Resistance**: People prefer familiar workflows
- **Overloading Early Adopters**: Don't burn out your champions

### Measurement Pitfalls
- **Vanity Metrics**: Focus on meaningful impact, not just activity
- **Short-term Focus**: Long-term adoption matters more than initial spike
- **Single Source Data**: Multiple data sources provide better insights
- **Delayed Measurement**: Early indicators predict long-term success

### Feedback Pitfalls
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Perfect data isn't needed to start improving
- **Feedback Theater**: Collecting without acting destroys trust
- **Bias Toward Complainers**: Balance negative feedback with silent success
- **Over-customization**: Some standardization benefits all users

## Tips for Effective Usage

1. **Provide Context**: Share user research, personas, and historical data
2. **Be Specific About Users**: "Junior developers" not "developers"
3. **Define Success Clearly**: Quantifiable metrics drive better planning
4. **Include Constraints**: Time, budget, and resource limitations matter
5. **Request Scenarios**: Ask for best/worst case adoption scenarios
6. **Iterate on Plans**: User impact assessment evolves with learning
7. **Validate Assumptions**: Test adoption hypotheses early and often

The npl-user-impact-assessor agent ensures that project management maintains focus on real user value creation and sustainable adoption patterns throughout the development lifecycle. It transforms technical projects into user success stories by keeping the user perspective central to all planning decisions.
