# Quality Assurance Agents

The Quality Assurance category provides specialized NPL agents for comprehensive testing, validation, and quality control of code and systems. These agents work together to ensure reliability, performance, and correctness across different aspects of software development.

## Available Agents

### 1. npl-tester
**Purpose**: Automated test generation and execution for code validation

The npl-tester agent creates and runs comprehensive test suites, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. It analyzes code structure to identify test gaps and generates appropriate test cases with edge case coverage.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Test suite generation from specifications
- Coverage analysis and gap identification
- Mock and stub creation
- Test data generation
- Regression test maintenance

### 2. npl-benchmarker
**Purpose**: Performance measurement and optimization analysis

The npl-benchmarker agent conducts systematic performance testing, measures execution times, memory usage, and resource consumption. It identifies bottlenecks and provides optimization recommendations based on benchmark results.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Performance profiling and metrics collection
- Comparative benchmarking across versions
- Load testing and stress testing
- Memory leak detection
- Optimization opportunity identification

### 3. npl-integrator
**Purpose**: Continuous integration and deployment pipeline management

The npl-integrator agent designs and maintains CI/CD pipelines, ensuring smooth integration of code changes and automated deployment processes. It coordinates build processes, test execution, and deployment strategies.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Pipeline configuration and optimization
- Build automation and artifact management
- Deployment strategy implementation
- Environment consistency verification
- Release coordination

### 4. npl-validator
**Purpose**: Data and schema validation for system integrity

The npl-validator agent performs comprehensive validation of data structures, API contracts, and system configurations. It ensures compliance with defined schemas, business rules, and regulatory requirements.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Schema validation and enforcement
- API contract testing
- Data integrity verification
- Configuration validation
- Compliance checking

## Quality Assurance Pipeline

These agents can be orchestrated to create comprehensive quality assurance pipelines:

### Example: Full Testing Pipeline
```bash
# 1. Generate comprehensive test suite
@npl-tester generate tests --coverage=90 --include-edge-cases

# 2. Run performance benchmarks
@npl-benchmarker profile --baseline=v1.0 --compare=current

# 3. Validate all data contracts
@npl-validator check schemas --strict

# 4. Execute CI/CD pipeline
@npl-integrator run pipeline --stage=production
```

### Example: Pre-Release Quality Check
```bash
# Parallel quality checks
@npl-tester run regression & \
@npl-benchmarker check performance-regression & \
@npl-validator verify api-contracts & \
@npl-integrator validate deployment-config

# Generate quality report
@npl-tester coverage report && \
@npl-benchmarker summary --format=dashboard
```

### Example: Continuous Quality Monitoring
```bash
# Set up automated quality gates
@npl-integrator configure gates \
  --test-coverage=85 \
  --performance-threshold=2s \
  --validation-rules=strict

# Monitor and alert on quality metrics
@npl-benchmarker monitor --alert-on-regression
@npl-validator watch --schemas=api/** --notify-on-violation
```

## Templaterized Customization

All quality assurance agents support NPL templaterization for project-specific customization:

```npl
{{#with project_config}}
  test_framework: {{test_framework}}
  coverage_target: {{coverage_threshold}}
  performance_baseline: {{performance_metrics}}
  validation_rules: {{validation_schema}}
{{/with}}
```

This allows teams to:
- Define project-specific testing strategies
- Customize performance benchmarks
- Configure validation rules per environment
- Adapt CI/CD pipelines to organizational standards

## Integration with Development Workflow

Quality assurance agents integrate seamlessly with development workflows:

### Pre-Commit Hooks
```bash
# Validate before commit
@npl-validator check modified-files
@npl-tester run unit --changed-only
```

### Pull Request Validation
```bash
# Comprehensive PR checks
@npl-tester run suite --pr={{PR_NUMBER}}
@npl-benchmarker compare --base=main --head={{BRANCH}}
@npl-validator verify contracts --diff
```

### Release Qualification
```bash
# Full release validation
@npl-integrator qualify-release \
  --run-all-tests \
  --benchmark-performance \
  --validate-deployment
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Early and Often**: Use npl-tester for TDD and continuous testing
2. **Benchmark Regularly**: Track performance trends with npl-benchmarker
3. **Automate Everything**: Leverage npl-integrator for full automation
4. **Validate Continuously**: Use npl-validator to catch issues early
5. **Combine Agents**: Orchestrate multiple agents for comprehensive quality assurance

## Getting Started

To begin using quality assurance agents in your project:

```bash
# Initialize quality assurance configuration
@npl-integrator init qa-pipeline

# Set up test framework
@npl-tester init --framework=pytest --coverage-tool=coverage

# Configure performance baselines
@npl-benchmarker baseline create --profile=production

# Define validation schemas
@npl-validator init schemas --format=openapi
```

These agents work together to ensure your code meets the highest quality standards through automated testing, performance monitoring, continuous integration, and comprehensive validation.
